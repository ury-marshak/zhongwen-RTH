吾	I [literary]				wú	0018	7		There are a number of characters for the word <b>I</b>, but this one is restricted to literary use in Chinese. We need a sufficiently stuffy connotation for the key word, for which the sense of a &quot;perceiving subject&quot; should do just fine. Now the one place in our bodies that all <i>five</i> senses are concentrated in is the head, which has no less than <i>five</i> <i>mouths</i>: 2 nostrils, 2 ears, and 1 mouth. Hence, <i>five mouths</i> = <b>I</b>.

Each of them has come to represent one of the common connotations of this key word: the sun, the <b>bright</b> insight of the clear thinker, and the moon, the <b>bright</b> intuition of the poet and the seer.

唱	to sing				chàng	0021	11		This one is easy! You have one <i>mouth</i> making no noise (the choirmaster) and two <i>mouths with wagging tongues</i> (the minimum for a chorus). So when you hear the key word <b>sing</b>, think of the Vienna Boys' Choir or the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the character is yours forever (see frame 12).

And if you've ever held a diamond up to the light, you will have noticed how every facet of it becomes like a miniature <i>sun</i>. This character is a picture of a tiny <i>sun</i> in three places (that is, ""everywhere""), to give the sense of something <b>sparkling</b> all over the place. Just like a diamond. In writing the primitive elements three times, note again how the rule for writing given in frame 4 holds true not only for the strokes in each individual element but also for the disposition of the elements in the character as a whole.

昌	prosperous				chāng	0024	8		What we mentioned in the previous two frames about three of something meaning &quot;everywhere&quot; or &quot;heaps of&quot; was not meant to be taken lightly. In this character we see two <i>suns</i>, one atop the other, which, if we are not careful, is easily confused in memory with the three <i>suns</i> of <i>sparkling</i>. Focus on the number this way: since we speak of <b>prosperous</b> times as <i>sunny</i>, what could be more prosperous than a sky with two <i>suns</i> in it? Just be sure to actually see them there. [8]			昌		prosperous; flourishing	AA	002400	<dl><dt>hojuren:</dt><dd>Work every day to make money.</dd></dl>	RTH RTH1
早	early		As a primitive element, this character takes the meaning of <i>sunflower</i>, which was used to make the abstract key word <i>early</i> more graphic.		zǎo	0025	6		This character is actually a picture of the first flower of the day, which we shall, in defiance of botanical science, call the <i>sun</i>-flower, since it begins with the element for <i>sun</i> and is held up on a stem with leaves (the pictographic representation of the final two strokes). This time, however, we shall ignore the pictograph and imagine <i>sun</i>flowers with <i>needles</i> for stems, which can be plucked and used to darn your socks. The sense of <b>early</b> is easily remembered if one thinks of the <i>sun</i>flower as the <b>early</b> riser in the garden, because the <i>sun</i>, showing favoritism towards its namesake, shines on it before all the others (see frame 10). [6]			早		early; morning; for a long time, as early as ...

旭	Rising Sun				xù	0026	6		The key word here immediately suggests the islands located to the east of China, which would make it, from China's point of view, the Land of the <b>Rising Sun</b>, a name easily associated with Japan's national flag. If you can picture two seams running down that great red <i>sun</i>, and then imagine it sitting on a <i>baseball</i> bat for a flagpole, you have a slightly irreverent―but not altogether inaccurate―picture of how the sport has caught on in the Land of the <b>Rising Sun</b>.

If you look at this character in its completed form―not in its stroke order―you will see three <i>tens</i>. When writing it, think of the lower horizontal lines as ""addition"" lines written under numbers to add them up. Thus: <i>ten</i> ""plus"" <i>ten</i> ""plus"" <i>ten</i> = thirty. Actually, it's a lot easier doing it with a pencil than reading it in a book.

胃	Stomach				wèi	0028	9		"You will need to refer back to frames 13 and 14 here for the special meaning of the two primitive elements that make up this character: <i>brain</i> and <i>flesh (part of the body)</i>. What the character says, if you look at it, is that the <i>part of the body</i> that keeps the <i>brain</i> in working order is the <b>stomach</b>. To keep the elements in proper order, when you write this character think of the <i>brain</i> as being ""held up"" by the <i>flesh</i>.

旦	Daybreak				dàn	0029	5		The obvious sign of <b>daybreak</b> is the <i>sun</i> peeking out over the horizon, which is pretty much what this character depicts. If you can imagine the <i>sun</i> poking its head out through a hole in your <i>floor</i>, however, you will have an easier time remembering this character. [5]			旦		dawn, morning, day-break	AM	002900		RTH RTH1
凹	concave				āo	0030	5		You couldn't have asked for a better key word for this character! Just have a look at it: a perfect image of a concave lens (remembering, of course, that the characters square off rounded things), complete with its own little &quot;cave.&quot; Now all you have to do is learn how to write it.

凸	convex				tū [普], tú [國]	0031	5		Maybe this helps you see how the Chinese have no trouble keeping <b>convex</b> distinct from <i>concave</i>. Note the odd feeling of the fourth stroke. If it doesn't feel all that strange now, by the time you are done with this book, it will. There are very few times you will have to write it.

自	oneself		The same meaning of <i>oneself</i> can be kept when this character is used as a primitive element, but you will generally find it better to give it the meaning of <i>nose</i> or <i>nostrils</i>, both because it accords with the story above and because it is the first part of the character for <i>nose</i> (frame 575).		zì	0032	6		You can think of this character as a stylized pictograph of the nose, that little <i>drop</i> that Mother Nature set between your <i>eyes</i>. The Chinese often refer to themselves by pointing a finger at their nose―giving us an easy way to remember the character for <b>oneself</b>.

白	white		As a primitive, this character can either retain its meaning of <i>white</i> or take the more graphic meaning of a <i>white bird</i> or <i>dove</i>. This stems from the fact that it appears at the top of the character for <i>bird</i>, which we shall get to later (frame 1396).		bái	0033	5		The color <b>white</b> is a mixture of all the primary colors, both for pigments and for light, as we see when a prism breaks up the rays of the <i>sun</i>. Hence, a single <i>drop</i> of <i>sun</i> spells <b>white</b>. [5]			白		white, pure, unblemished; clear, plain	HA	003300	<dl><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd>A single <em>drop</em> of <em>sun</em> is pure<strong> white</strong>.</dd></dl>	RTH RTH1
百	hundred				bǎi	0034	6		"When the Japanese borrowed the Chinese characters, they often played with their shapes to find interesting connections. For example, they came to refer to a person's 99th birthday as the start of the ""<i>white</i> year"" because <i>white</i> is the character you are left with if you subtract <i>one</i> from a <b>hundred</b>.

(thanks to sethimayne).</dd></dl>"	RTH RTH1
皂	Soap				zào	0035	7		Whatever the color of the <b>soap</b> that this character refers to, it does the same trick of <i>cutting</i> the grease and grime to make things <i>white</i>. That's a bit too abstract and reasonable, though, so you may want to imagine looking at the soap under a microscope and seeing little whirling blades <i>dicing</i> the blotches of dirt one by one until everything turns <i>white</i>. [7]			皂		soap; black	HAP	003500	<dl><dt>hojuren:</dt><dd>Think of Snow <em>White</em> scrubbing <em>Seven</em> grubby dwarves with one tiny bar of<strong> SOAP</strong>.</dd></dl>	RTH RTH1
中	Middle				zhōng	0036	4		"The elements in this character are a <i>walking stick</i> and a <i>mouth</i>. The connotation we will associate with the key word <b>middle</b> is that period of life known as <b>middle</b> age, so called because it is the time in your life when you have trouble with your expanding ""<b>middle</b>."" More often than not, the expansion has to do with eating more and moving around less. This character has the<br />grotesque image of a person with a <i>walking stick</i> jammed into his <i>mouth</i>, the more easily to shovel food in without the interference of the tedious exercise of opening and closing it. [4]<br />Note the indicator that the character for <b>middle</b> can be used as either a noun or an adjective. Where no part of speech is indicated, assume the most common. In the case of the former frame, for example, <i>soap</i> might be taken as a verb, but one's first thought goes to the noun, which is a good place to start for that character. Be aware, though, that even where one part of speech is indicated for a character, other possibilities may exist."			中		center, middle; central; in the midst of; ALSO: China	L	003600		RTH RTH1
千	thousand				qiān	0037	3		This character is almost too simple to pull apart, but for the sake of practice, have a look at the <i>eyedropper</i> above and the <i>ten</i> below. Now put the elements together by thinking of squeezing two more zeros out of an eyedropper alongside the number <i>ten</i> to make it a <b>thousand</b>.

舌	Tongue				shé	0038	6		"The characters for <i>mouth</i> and <i>thousand</i> naturally form the idea of <b>tongue</b> if one thinks of a <i>thousand</i> <i>mouths</i> able to speak the same language, or as we say, ""sharing a common <b>tongue</b>."" It is easy to see the connection between the idiom and the character if you take its image literally: a single <b>tongue</b> being passed around from <i>mouth</i> to <i>mouth</i>.

升	Liter				shēng	0039	4		Think of a one-<b>liter</b> carafe (the kind you might serve drinks in) filled not with milk or wine but with a <i>thousand</i> sharp <i>needles</i>. You may well wonder what they are doing there, but the answer is simple: it's a kind of sports drink for a robot.

昇	to rise up				shēng	0040	8		Keeping the image from the last frame, we have here a <i>liter</i> carafe with a <i>sun</i> above it. Conveniently, the connotation of the key word <b>rise up</b> is what the <i>sun</i> does in the morning, just before breakfast. Can you actually SEE it <b>rising up</b> out of the <i>liter</i> carafe of freshly squeezed <i>Sun</i>kist orange juice on your breakfast table?

丸	Pill		As a primitive, this element takes the meaning of a <i>bottle of pills</i>.		wán	0041	3		One of the scourges of sports like modern baseball has been the use of performance-enhancing drugs, those tiny little pills that have helped turn honest competition into cut-throat business. Now look at the character and picture it as a bottle of pills hanging on the thigh of a baseball player like a pez dispenser, ready for the popping as the need arises.

占	to tell fortunes				zhān	0043	5		This is one of those characters that is a real joy of simplicity: a <i>divining rod</i> with a <i>mouth</i> ― which are the two ingredients needed to <b>tell fortunes</b>. Note how the movement from top to bottom (the movement in which the characters are written) is also the order of the elements which make up our story and of the key word itself: first <i>divining rod</i>, then <i>mouth</i>. This will not always be possible, but where it is, memory has almost no work at all to do.

上	above				shàng	0044	3		"The two directions, <b>above</b> and <i>below</i>, are usually pointed at with the finger. But the characters do not follow that custom, so we have to choose something else, easily remembered.

In addition to giving us two new characters, the two shapes in this and the preceding frame also serve to illustrate the difference between the primitive meanings for <i>ceiling</i> and <i>floor</i>: it all depends on whether the single horizontal line stands above or <b>below</b> the primitive element to which it is related.

卡	Card				kǎ	0046	5		The key word <b>card</b> can stand for all sorts of things, but let's settle on a credit <b>card</b> for our image. Perhaps the first thing that comes to mind is the picture of a shopkeeper sliding your credit <b>card</b> up and down (from <i>above</i> to <i>below</i> and back again) in the reading machine to record your transaction.

卓	eminent				zhuó	0047	8		The word <b>eminent</b> suggests a famous or well-known person. So all you need to do―given the primitives of a <i>magic wand</i> and a <i>sunflower</i> ― is to think of the world's most <b>eminent</b> magician as one who uses a <i>sunflower</i> for a <i>magic wand</i> (like a flower-child who goes around turning the world into peace and love).

朝	Dynasty				cháo	0048	12		It is easy to imagine one of the great <b>dynasties</b> of China in all its glory. Now all we have to figure out is what the elements <i>moon</i> and <i>mist</i> have to do with it. Picture a great palace with a powerful emperor seated on a throne in its innermost court. To keep the Wizard-of-Oz illusion that this power is beyond question and beyond the understanding of the masses, the whole complex is kept permanently shrouded in <i>mist</i>. How do they do it, you ask. On one side of the throne is a servant pulling on a cord to wave a gigantic fan back and forth. On the other, a servant with a long cord hooked on a corner of the quarter <i>moon</i>. When he pulls on it, the <i>moon</i> tilts over and spills out a month's supply of <i>mist</i> that keeps the myth of the dynasty alive.

貝	Shellfish		When this character is used as a primitive, in addition to <i>shellfish</i>, the meanings <i>shells</i>, <i>oysters</i>, and <i>clams</i> will often come in handy.		bèi	0051	7		To remember the primitive elements that make up this charac-<br />ter, an <i>eye</i> and <i>animal legs</i>, you might be tempted to think of it<br />as a pictograph of a <b>shellfish</b> with its ridged shell at the top and<br />two little <i>legs</i> sticking out of the bottom. But that might not help<br />you recall later just how many ridges to put on the shell. Better<br />to imagine a freakish <b>shellfish</b> with a single, gigantic <i>eye</i> roam-<br />ing the beaches on its slender little <i>legs</i>, scaring the wits out of<br />the sunbathers.

貼	to paste				tiē	0052	12		Think here of brushing on an adhesive, as when you paste<br />something on a billboard. Here we have an oyster pasting a<br />poster on his back to advertise his services in the dubious occu-<br />pation of one who tells fortunes. Try to imagine the problem<br />he would have reaching his back with the brush to paste, and<br />then see him strutting around and calling out, &quot;Fortunes to tell!<br />Fortunes to tell!&quot; [12]			贴		to paste to, stick on, glue; attached to	BCYR	005200	<dl><dt>hojuren:</dt><dd>To make <em>money</em> (<em>clams</em>) the gypsy <strong>pastes</strong> posters all around town, advertising her <em>fortune telling</em> services.</dd><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd>To make <em>money</em> (<em>clams</em>) the gypsy <strong>pastes</strong> posters all around town, advertising her <em>fortune telling</em> services (thanks to kanjihito).</dd></dl>	RTH RTH1
貞	chaste				zhēn	0053	9		You have heard of Diogenes running around with his lamp<br />looking for an honest man. Here we have an image of the<br />famous shellfish, Oysterogenes, running around with his divin-<br />ing rod looking for a chaste man.

員	Employee				yuán	0054	10		How do we get a mouth over a shellfish to mean an employee?<br />Simple. Just remember the advice new employees get about<br />keeping their mouths shut and doing their jobs, and then make<br />that more graphic by picturing an office building full of white-<br />collar workers scurrying around with clams pinched to their<br />mouths.

While we presume two were made of<br>every other creature as well, we are not told as much. Hence we<br>need only two and a pair of human legs to come to the character<br>that means beginning.

頑	stubborn				wán	0058	13		This character refers to a blockhead, a persistently stubborn<br />person who sticks to an idea or a plan just the way it was at the<br />beginning, without letting anything that comes up along the way<br />alter things in the least. The explanation makes &quot;sense,&quot; but is<br />hard to remember because the word &quot;beginning&quot; is too abstract.<br />Back up to the image we used two frames ago―Adam and Eve<br />in their Eden―and try again: The root of all this goes back to<br />the beginning, with two brothers each defending his own way<br />of life and asking their God to bless it favorably. Abel stuck to<br />agriculture, Cain to animal-raising. Picture these two seeking<br />the favors of heaven, one of them with an unusually stubborn<br />grimace on his face.

肌	Muscle				jī	0060	6		One of the more common ways of testing the strength of one's<br />muscles is to lock hands with a local hulk on a small table top<br />and arm wrestle. This is the image here, depicted by the ele-<br />ments for part of the body and small table. The muscle is, there-<br />fore, the part of the body you test by literally bringing it to the<br />small table.

負	defeated				fù	0061	9		Above we have the condensed form of bound up, and below, the<br>familiar shellfish. Now imagine two oysters engaged in shell-to-<br>shell combat, the one who is defeated being bound and gagged<br>with seaweed, the victor towering triumphantly over it. The<br>bound shellfish thus becomes the symbol for anyone or any-<br>thing that has been defeated.

勻	uniform				yún	0062	4		The two primitives bound up and two (clearer in the hand-<br />drawn form) combine to give the meaning of uniform. One<br />of the real challenges for primary school teachers is to keep<br />students from scattering every which direction. If you think<br />of the final touch to a school outfit, the shoes, and then recall<br />the childhood jingle, &quot;One, two, buckle my shoe,&quot; the solution<br />is near at hand. Instead of having children buckle their shoes,<br />they can be taught to tie their shoelaces together by changing<br />the lyrics to read &quot;One, two, bind up my shoes.&quot; This keeps them<br />from straying very far from the group and helps teachers pro-<br />vide a uniform education. [4]			匀		equal; evenly (divided); uniform	PMM	006200	"<dl><dt>hojuren:</dt><dd>I <em>bound</em> the <em>2</em> girls together for not wearing the school<strong> uniform</strong>.</dd><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd>In olden days China, part of the uniform of an upper-classs woman involved <em>binding up</em> your <em>two</em> feet tightly with cloth- <em>one, two</em>, pull, ouch.

句	Sentence				jù	0063	5		By combining the two primitives bound up and mouth, it is easy<br>to see how this character can have the meaning of a sentence.<br>The mouth suggests it is a spoken sentence. To be more precise,<br>it is a cluster of words bound up tightly and neatly so that they<br>will fit in your mouth. [5]			句		sentence, phrase, clause; MW for verse	PR	006300	<dl><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd>I wish i could <em>bind up</em> my teachers <em>mouth</em>, so he can't utter another dull boring sentence..</dd></dl>	RTH RTH1
旬	Decameron				xún	0064	6		There simply is not a good phrase in English for the block of ten<br />days which this character represents. So we resurrect the classi-<br />cal term decameron, whose connotations the tales of Boccaccio<br />have done much to enrich. Actually, it refers to a journey of<br />ten days taken by a band of people―that is, a group of people<br />bound together for the days of the decameron. [6]			旬		a ten-day period	PA	006400	<dl><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd>A<strong> decameron</strong> is 10 <em>days</em>, all <em>bound up</em> in a neat little package.</dd></dl>	RTH RTH1
勺	Ladle		If you want to bind up drops of anything―water, soup, lemon-<br>ade―you use something to scoop these drops up, which is what<br>we call a ladle. See the last drop left inside the ladle?

首	Heads				shǒu	0067	9		Reading this character from the top down, we have: horns ...<br>nose. Together they bring to mind the picture of a moose-head<br>hanging on the den wall, with its great horns and long nose. The<br>plural form is used to stress the frequent metaphorical use of<br>the term to refer to various kinds of heads, including heads of<br>state. It might help to see a number of the latter lined up on the<br>den wall alongside the moose, each fitted out with antlers and a<br>whopper of a nose.<br>Here we get a good look at what we mentioned when we first<br>introduced the element for horns: that they can never be left<br>floating free and require an extra horizontal stroke to prevent<br>that from happening, as is the case here. [9]			首		head, chief, leader; first (occasion or thing); MW for poems	THBU	006700	<dl><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd>Moose heads on the wall - <em>horns</em> and a huge <em>nose</em> hanging below.</dd></dl>	RTH RTH1
直	straight				zhí	0068	8		Think of the first two elements, ten eyes, as referring to a group<br>of five scientists working together on a top-secret, million-<br>dollar project to draw a straight line on the floor without the<br>aid of special equipment. In the end, all ten eyes verify that it<br>is straight, leaving no doubt that the use of government funds<br>was fully justified. Time to apply for another grant.<br>Note how the first two strokes of the element for eye are made<br>a little longer so that they can touch the final stroke. The same<br>thing will happen in the following three characters, and later on<br>as well, so pay particular attention to the stroke order below. [8]			直		straight, vertical, upright, erect; frank, candid	JBMM	006800	<dl><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd>New primitive - large eye with 4 horizontal strokes = <em>both eyes</em>.

置	to set up				zhì	0069	13		Think of having to set up the net for a badminton or volleyball<br>game. One of the main problems is how to keep the net in a<br>straight line so that it doesn't sag in the middle. Which is just<br>what this character shows us. [13]			置		place, arrange, lay out; set aside	WLJBM	006900	<dl><dt>hojuren:</dt><dd>Need to<strong> set up</strong> table tennis <em>net</em> in a <em>straight</em> line.</dd></dl>	RTH RTH1
具	Tool				jù	0070	8		Here is the full character on which the primitive of the last<br />frame is based. If you can think of a table full of carpenter's<br />tools of all sorts, each equipped with its own eye so that it can<br />keep a watch over what you are doing with it, you won't have<br />trouble later keeping the primitive and the character apart. [8]			具		tool, instrument, device; equipment	BMMC	007000	<dl><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd>When rooting through your Dad's<strong> tool</strong> box, you need to keep <em>both eyes</em> peeled for rusty blades or nails.

真	true				zhēn	0071	10		Here is an example of how there can be different ways of identi-<br />fying the primitive elements that make up a character. The most<br />obvious is straight and animal legs, but the character could as<br />well be analyzed into ten and tool. Let's choose the latter.<br />How do you know if something is true or not? What if there<br />were a kit of ten tools you could count on to run a test? Well, at<br />least when it comes to asking whether people are really true to<br />themselves, the ten commandments are a good start. [10]<br />			真		real, true, actual, genuine	JBMC	007100	<dl><dt>hojuren:</dt><dd>Lie detector is a <em>tool</em> that tells whether telling truth or not.

工	the Work		Since the key word can be too abstract when used as a primitive element, we will often revert to the clearer image of an <i>I-beam</i>.		gōng	0072	3		The pictograph of an I-beam, like the kind that is used in heavy<br>construction work on buildings and bridges, gives us the char-<br>acter for work. [3]			工		work, labor, worker; working class; skill, (cp: 唱工; chànggōng; the art of singing)	MLM	007200	<dl><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd><em>I</em> work really hard learning these damn hanzi!</dd></dl>	RTH RTH1
左	Left				zuǒ	0073	5		"By combining the last two frames and reading the results, we<br>get: by ones side... work. Conveniently, the left has traditionally<br>been considered the ""sinister"" side, where dark and occult works<br>are cultivated and carried out.

右	Right				yòu	0074	5		"When thinking of the key word right, in order to avoid con-<br>fusion with the previous frame, take advantage of the double<br>meaning here. Imagine a little mouth hanging down by one's<br>side―one's right side, of course―like a little voice of conscience<br>telling one the ""right"" thing to do.

有	to possess				yǒu	0075	6		The picture here is a slab of flesh dangling by one's side, perhaps<br>from a belt or rope tied around the waist. While we normally<br>think of things that we have and possess, we also know that<br>there are things that can have and possess us. Such cases might<br>be likened to an evil spirit possessing one's soul. This character<br>suggests a way to exorcize it: hang a slab of fresh flesh by one's<br>side until it begins to putrefy and stink so bad that the demon<br>departs. Take careful note of the stroke order. [6]			有		have, own, possess; exist	KB	007500	<dl><dt>hojuren:</dt><dd>If I could<strong> possess</strong> the <em>moon</em> I would give it to you so you could hang it by your <em>side</em>!</dd><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd>In the fight for survival in prehistoric times, the most important thing to<strong> possess</strong> was <em>meat</em> <em>by your side</em> which could be eaten at any time.

賄	bribe				huì	0076	13		To the left we have the primitive for a shellfish, and to the right,<br />the character we just learned for possess. Keep the connotation<br />of the last frame for the word possess, and now expand your<br />image of shells to include the ancient value they had as money<br />(a usage that will come in very helpful later on). Now people<br />who are possessed by shells are likely to abandon any higher<br />principles to acquire more and more wealth. These are the easi-<br />est ones to persuade with a bribe of a few extra shells.

貢	Tribute				gòng	0077	10		A tribute has a kind of double meaning in English: honor paid<br />freely and money (shells) collected by coercion. Simply because<br />a ruler bestows a noble name on a deed is hardly any consola-<br />tion to the masses who must part with their hard-earned shells.<br />Little wonder that this ancient work of gathering money by call-<br />ing it a tribute has given way to a name closer to how it feels to<br />those who pay it: a tax. [10]<br />			贡		tribute, gifts	MBUC, XMBUC	007700	"<dl><dt>hojuren:</dt><dd>Takes a lot of hard <em>work</em> to pay the<strong> tribute</strong> because it must be paid in <em>shellfish</em>.</dd><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd>""This next song is a<strong> TRIBUTE</strong> to a little <em>SHELLFISH</em> friend of mine who was tragically stepped on while I was at <em>work</em>"".</dd></dl>"	RTH RTH1

刀	Sword		In the form of the character, this primitive means a <i>dagger</i>. When it appears to the right of another element, it is commonly stretched out like this 刂, and like this 'J when to the left of another element. In these cases, it will take the sense of a great and flashing <i>saber</i>, a meaning it gets from a character to be introduced in Book 2.		dāo	0079	2		Although this character no longer looks very much like a sword,<br />it does have some resemblance to the handle of the sword. As<br />it turns out, this is to our advantage, in that it helps us make a<br />distinction between two primitive elements based on this char-<br />acter. [2]<br />			刀		knife, dagger	SH	007900	<dl><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd>Pictograph of the grip and guard of a<strong> sword</strong> - the blade (should be sticking upwards) is missing.

切	to cut				qiē	0081	4		To the right we see the dagger and next to it the number seven,<br />whose primitive meaning we decided would be diced (frame<br />7). It is hard to cut meat or vegetables with a knife without<br />imagining one of those skillful Japanese chefs. Only let us say<br />that he has had too much sake to drink at a party, grabs a dag-<br />ger lying on the mantelpiece and starts dicing up everything in<br />sight, starting with the hors d'oeuvres and going on to cut up<br />the furniture and carpets....

召	to summon		The primitive meaning remains the same. Just be sure to associate it with a very concrete image, such as a prosecutor at your door with a document that summons you to appear in court. /<div>&nbsp; <b>Pentagram</b></div>		zhào	0082	5		A sword or dagger poised over a mouth is how the character<br />used to summon a person is written. Note the immediate―how<br />shall we put it politely?―Freudian implications of the charac-<br />ter. (Observe, too, if you will, that it is not at all clear whether<br />the long slender object is summoning the small round one or<br />vice versa.)

Think of digging for clams in an area where there are<br />gaming rules governing how large a find has to be before you<br />can keep it.

副	vice—				fù	0085	11		The key word vice- has the sense of someone second-in-com-<br />mand. The great and flashing saber to the right (its usual loca-<br />tion, so you need not worry about where to put it from now<br />on) and the wealth on the left combine to create an image of<br />dividing one's property to give a share to one's vice-wealth-<br />holder.

叮	to sting				dīng	0087	5		You know how a bee stings, right? It drives the little barbed<br />spike in its bottom into your skin and then pulls away. Of course,<br />as we noted way back in frame 11, the primitive element for<br />mouth can refer to any kind of orifice, but imagine the damage<br />a bee could inflict if it could sting with its mouth at the same<br />time―a kind of bi-polar attack.

頂	crest				dǐng	0090	11		The key word can refer to the summit or crest of a mountain,<br />but the crest of the head works better here. The immediate<br />image this conjures up is the head of a rooster with its comb<br />or a cockatoo with its crest feathers. And from there it is but a<br />short step to think of the punk hairstyles that imitate this look<br />by shaping the hair into a row of brightly colored spikes. So a<br />spike-head becomes a crest.

乙	second		Since this is also a pictograph of a <i>hook</i> or <i>fishhook</i>, let us take these as primitive meanings. Its shape will rarely be quite the same as that of the character. When it appears at the bottom of another primitive, it is straightened out, almost as if the weight of the upper element had bent it out of shape:𠃊&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />When it appears to the right of another element, the short horizontal line that gets the shape started is omitted, and the whole character is stretched out and narrowed ― all for reasons of space and aesthetics: 乚&nbsp;&nbsp;		yǐ	0091	1		This character belongs to the same series of &quot;celestial stems&quot; as<br />that in frame 86 of the last lesson.

子	child		As a primitive, this character retains the meaning of <i>child</i>, though you might imagine a little older <i>child</i>, able to run around and get into more mischief.		zǐ	0092	3		This character is a pictograph of a child wrapped up in one of<br />those handy cocoons that Indian squaws fix to their backs to<br />carry around young children who cannot get around by them-<br />selves. (Incidentally, this is why English has taken over the<br />word &quot;papoose&quot; from the Algonquin language to refer to the<br />device itself.) The first stroke is like a wee head popping out for<br />air; the second shows the body and legs all wrapped up; and the<br />final stroke shows the arms sticking out to cling to the mother's<br />neck.

孔	cavity				kǒng	0093	4		A cavity is really just a small hole, but the first thing we think<br />of when we hear the word is that little pothole that shows up in<br />a diseased tooth. The Chinese may not use the character in this<br />sense, but what's to stop us?.<br />Probably the one thing most children fear more than anything<br />else is the dentist's chair. Can you remember the first time as a<br />child you saw your dentist hold an x-ray up to the light and pro-<br />nounce the ominous word &quot;cavity&quot;? Even though you were not<br />likely to know that the word meant that you have an extra hole<br />in your head until you were much older, it did not take long<br />before the sound got associated with the drill and that row of<br />shiny hooks the dentist uses to torture people who are too small<br />to fight back. [4]			孔		opening, hole, vent, aperture	NDU	009300	<dl><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd>Our <em>child</em> has a<strong> cavity</strong> so he's got to go to the dentist.

吼	to roar				hǒu	0094	7		A mouth and a cavity combine to create the character for roar.<br>It shouldn't tax your memory banks too much to think back<br>to how you howled and roared the first time you had a cavity<br>drilled by a doctor poking around inside your mouth with his<br>weapons of dental destruction.

女	Woman		The primitive meaning is the same: <i>woman</i>. It will help if you have a particular person in mind.		nǚ	0096	3		You have probably seen somewhere the form of a squatting<br>woman drawn behind this character, with two legs at the bot-<br>tom, two arms (the horizontal line) and the head poking out<br>the top.

如	to be like		Duckface (<i>Woman</i> does it with her <i>mouth</i> to <b>be like</b> some celebrity)		rú	0098	6		Pardon us if we revert to the venerable old Dr. Freud again,<br />but his eye for symbolism is often helpful to appreciate things<br />that more earthy imaginations once accepted more freely but<br />that we have learned to cover over with a veneer of etiquette.<br />For instance, from ancient times things like the mouth of a<br />cave have served as natural ritual substitutes for the opening<br />through which a woman gives birth. This is just one example of<br />the way in which one thing can be like another in a metaphori-<br />cal sense and can therefore help unlock the hidden meanings of<br />ritual and symbolism.

母	Mother		As a primitive, this character will take on the added meaning of <i>breasts</i> in accord with the explanation given above. Take careful note of the fact that the form is altered slightly when this character serves as a primitive, the two dots joining together to form a longer stroke: 毌. An example follows in the next frame.		mǔ	0099	5		Look closely at this character and you will find the outline of<br />the character for woman in it, the second stroke of which has<br />been expanded to make space for the two breasts that help a<br />mother be a mother.

貫	to pierce				guàn	0100	11		If one is asked to think of associations for the word pierce,<br />among the first to come to mind is that of piercing one's ears<br />to hold earrings, a quite primitive form of self-mutilation that<br />has survived into the twenty-first century. The character here<br />is read, top to bottom: mother . . . oyster. All you need to do is<br />imagine piercing an ear so that it can hold a mother-of-pearl<br />you have just wrested from an oyster. [11]			贯		to pierce, pass through; to string together	WJBUC	010000	<dl><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd>My <em>mother</em> sat on a sharp <em>shellfish</em> and <strong>pierced</strong> her bottom!</dd></dl>	RTH RTH1
兄	Elder Brother		As a primitive this character will take the meaning of <i>teenager</i>, in accord with the familiar image of the big <i>mouth</i> and the gangling, clumsy <i>legs</i>.		xiōng	0101	5		The difference between &quot;older brother&quot; (frame 89) and elder<br />brother is ever so slight in English, the latter sounding just a bit<br />less colloquial. The same is the case in Chinese.<br />By now characters like this one should &quot;look like&quot; something<br />to you even though it is more of an &quot;ideogram&quot; than a &quot;picto-<br />graph.&quot; The large mouth on top and the human legs below almost<br />jump off the page as a caricature of elder brother, the one with<br />the big mouth (or if you prefer a kinder image, the one who &quot;has<br />the say&quot; among all the children).

吵	noisy				chǎo	0105	7		<div><i>Mouth</i>...<i>Shàolín monk(few)</i>.<br />You might think that noisy should be associated with many peo-</div>ple talking at once, but the idea in this character is much more<br />philosophical than that: What happens when things get noisy<br />is that peopled vocabulary shrinks to a more neolithic level the<br />higher the volume is turned up. And so it is that noisy becomes<br />associated with the very few things a mouth can say when it<br />is talking loudly. Try to picture people quoting Shakespeare to<br />each other in a shouting match, and you will see how right this<br />character is.

大	large		When used as a primitive, this character needs a different meaning, since the element representing the human person will come up later. Therefore, this shape will become a <i>large dog</i> or, if you prefer, a <i>St. Bernard dog</i>. In frame 225 we will explain why this choice was made.		dà	0106	3		Here we have a simple pictograph of a person taking up the<br />space of an entire character and giving it the sense of large.

夕	Evening				xī [普], xì [國]	0108	3		"Just as the word evening adds a touch of formality or roman-<br />ticism to the ordinary word ""night"" so the character for eve-<br />ning takes the ordinary looking moon in the night sky and has<br />a cloud pass over it—partially hiding it and hence eliminating<br />the final stroke."			夕		evening, sunset; (dusk =&nbsp;&nbsp;xì )	NI	010800	<dl><dt>hojuren:</dt><dd>Getting dark - remove last stroke from moon.</dd><dt>aphasiac2:</dt><dd>In the early<strong> evening</strong>, the <em>moon</em> is not yet full, it is still crescent shaped..</dd></dl>	RTH RTH1

Now, as every magician worth his abraca-<br>dabra knows, bringing your magic wand out into the evening<br>air makes your magic much more powerful than if you were to<br>stay indoors.

石	stone		The <i>stone</i> is a quite common primitive element, which is not restricted to great boulders but is used for <i>pebbles</i> or <i>rocks</i> of any size or shape.		shí	0114	5		With a mouth under cliff, what else could we have here but the entrance to a secret cavern, before which a great stone has been rolled so that none may enter? Perhaps it is the hiding place where Ali Baba and his band of thieves have stored their treasures, in which case that magic word known to every school child who ever delighted in the tales of the Arabian Nights should be enough to push the stone aside. But take care—the cliff is steep, and one slip will send you tumbling down into the ravine below.<br />This is the first of two occasions (for the other, see frame 902) on which the second stroke in cliff will reach over slightly to the right beneath the horizontal stroke.

It can also be written stiffly, in five strokes, as 氺 in which case we will take it to mean a <i>snowflake</i>. An example will fol­low shortly.

願	a Wish				yuàn	0131	19		Flatlands and a head are all we are given to work with in the character for wish. Since the key word already suggests some­thing like a formal request made of some higher power, let us imagine a gigantic Wizard-of-Oz head located in the middle of the üowery flatlands we saw in the last frame.

First of all, take the water at the left as the drops of water that are used to depict water in general. In the best of all possible worlds, the most efficient way to extinguish a fire would be to see that each drop of water hits one spark of the conflagration.

土	Soil		When this character is used as a primitive, the sense of <i>soil</i> is extended to that of <i>ground</i> because of its connection with the character for the same (frame 478).

火	Fire		Although the generic meaning of <i>fire</i> can be carried over as a primitive meaning, it is usually best to keep to the mean­ing of <i>flames</i> or <i>fireplace</i>. Another primitive element for fire, based on this one, is written 灬 and will mean <i>cooking fire</i>.		huǒ	0157	4		Just as sitting before a fire enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the flames, this character is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of fire you want to see. It no longer makes a good pictograph, but we invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form一first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there一to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to ciga­rette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here.

炎	Inflammation				yán	0160	8		A fire belongs in the fireplace, not over it. When the fire spreads to the rest of the house, we have an inflammation of the house. As with any inflammation—including those that attack our bodies一the danger is always that it might spread if not checked. This is the sense behind the reduplication of the element for fire, one atop the other.

災	Disaster				zāi	0162	7		Of all of nature's disasters, this character picks out two of the worst floods dLTìdfires.

魚	a Fish				yú	0164	11		Breaking down this character give us three elements, which we list in the order of their writing: hound up... rice field... cooking fire. Not much to work with at first sight. But we can join them together by thinking of a three-part story: first a fish is caught and bound up on a line with its unfortunate schoolmates; when the fisherman gets home, he cuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the rice field for fertilizer; and the rest he sets in a skillet over a cookingfire for his supper.

漁	Fishing				yú	0165	14		To the story we have just made about fish, this character for the profession of fishing adds yet another element before the others: namely the water, where the fish was happily at home before being caught, disemboweled, and eaten.

堯	Yao		Used as a primitive, this character will be associated with the image of that unforgettable character in the Charlie Brown cartoon strips, <i>Pigpen</i>. Or, if you prefer, some par­ticularly memorable slob from your high-school days. The association should be obvious: <i>dirt</i>, <i>dirt</i> everywhere and a <i>pair of human legs</i>.		Yáo	0166	12		This character, used as a family name, is best associated with the legendary sage king Yao, who lived around 2300 все and became a model for rulers in ancient China. One fact about this king, which can help us remember the writing of the charac­ter, is that he is said to have invented the board game of Go as a way to sharpen the brain of his dim-witted son. Here we see the son as simply a pair of human legs (no brain attached), playing Go on the floor with little clumps of dirt (instead of the customary stones).

里	a Li [measurement]		To get a more concrete primitive meaning for this character, we shall refer to it as a <i>computer</i>, a meaning deriving from the character for <i>logic</i>, which we will meet in Lesson 12. To remember the meaning, it might help to think of the alternative meaning of the primitive at the top: <i>brains</i>.		lǐ	0169	7		That's right—a li. Don't bother looking it up in your English dictionary; it's a Chinese unit of distance. One li is about a half kilometer. The character depicts how the measure came to be used. Atop we see the rice field, and below the element for land. Think of those four sections you see in the rice field (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in frame 14) as blocks of land. Thus, a land division based on the size of a rice field would be a li.

黑	black				hēi	0172	12		Three frames ago we noted that it might help to think of the top part of the primitive for computer as brains. In this character you will see why. Note how the third stroke, ordinarily written as a single horizontal line, is here broken up into a pair of ani­mal horns right in the middle of the element. Think of this as a brain impaled (literally) on the horns of a dilemma.<br />That done, there is no problem with this character. Like most things electrical, a computer, too, can overheat, and often this happens because its brain is caught on the horns of a dilemma. Now look closely with your imaginative eye and you can see the horns sprouting out of the cpu and flames pouring out of the computer to char the keyboard, the monitor, and your desk a sooty black color.

同	same		When this character is used as a primitive, it will mean <i>monks</i> dressed in a common habit.		tóng	0176	6		he primitives in this character show us one and mouth under a hood.

We might say they all have the same habits, includ­ing the &quot;habit&quot; they wear on their backs. Here we see the monk's cowl, drawn down over the eyes so that all you can see when you look at him is a mouth. But since monks also speak their prayers in common, it is but a short step to think of one mouth under a hood as the character for everything that is the same about monastic life.

富	wealthy				fù	0189	12		Here we have the original character on which the primitive ele­ment for wealth is based. In keeping with the story introduced back then, note how many wealthy people get that way through simple inheritance, being born into the wealth of their parents' house.

木	Tree		As a primitive, this character can mean <i>tree</i> or <i>wood</i>. When the last two strokes are detached from the trunk (7k), we shall change its meaning to <i>pole</i> or <i>wooden pole</i>.		mù	0191	4		This is a pictograph of a tree, the main trunk shown in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke and the final two strokes sweeping down in both directions. Although it may look similar at first sight to the character for water (frame 126), the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance.

The more proper way to plant a young tree and give it a fair shake in life is to set it into the earth in such a way that it can grow up straight.

枯	withered				kū	0197	9		When a tree is withered and about to die, it is probably due to a kind of arteriosclerosis that keeps its sap from flowing freely. This character shows us an ancient and wrinkled tree with poor circulation, withered up and whiling away its remaining days in a retirement center.

相	one another				xiāng	0199	9		The key word one another stirs up associations of people inter­acting. When we read off the elements, tree... eye, we are given an idea of how to keep this interaction amicable by calling to mind the scriptural proverb about first taking the tree trunk out of your own eye before helping your neighbors remove the splinters from theirs.

未	not yet				wèi	0202	5		As the key word suggests, this character has to do with some­thing not quite over and done with. More concretely, it shows us a tree that is not yet fully grown. The extra short stroke in the upper branches shows new branches spreading out, leaving one with the feeling that the tree has a ways to go yet before it reaches maturity. In other words, the character conveys its meaning pictographically, playing on the earlier pictograph of the tree.

末	Last				mò	0203	5		This character is best learned in connection with that of the previous frame. The first stroke shows a branch that is longer than the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached the last of its growth, so that its top branches stop spreading and start drooping downwards. Be sure to keep this imagery in mind, to avoid confusing this key word with synonyms that will appear later.

沫	Foam				mò	0204	8		The foam this character refers to is the last stage of water after it has dashed and splashed against the rocks, spraying in all direc­tions. The foam is thus a wave that has run its full course and reached its last on the rocky seashore. If you picture it in your minds eye, this somewhat rare (but oh-so-easy-to-learn) char­acter is yours for good.

味	Flavor				wèi	0205	8		When a tree has not yet finished growing, it produces fruit with a full flavor. When the official taster (the professional mouth to the left) determines that full flavor has been reached, the tree is pruned back so that it remains permanently not yet grown. A neat little agricultural trick and an easy way to see the sense of flavor hidden in this character.

妹	younger sister				mèi	0206	8		The younger sister in the family is the woman in the family who, like the newest branch in a tree, is not yet old enough or mature enough to do everything the older sister can do (see frame 1298).

查	to investigate				chá	0207	9		To investigate is to get to the bottom of something or track something down, which often has you working all through the night, right to daybreak In the case of this character, it is Sir Isaac Newton, who is investigating the laws of physics when the appearance of the sun at daybreak prompts the tree to stretch and welcome a new day. At that, an apple drops from its branches square on Sir Isaac s head, inspiring him to discover the law of universal gravitation.

桌	Table				zhuō	0211	10		You have to think here of a group of magicians seated around a magical table, which is made out of the stump of a tree, and has the image of a large sun carved into its surface. The magicians pass the magic wand around from hand to hand to see if any of them can make the sun shine. At last, one of them succeeds, and the sun begins to glow (burning a hole in the table in the process).

若	as if				ruò	0212	9		Here we see a flower held in the right hand, calling to mind the famous story of the Buddha who held up a. flower with his right hand to a small gathering of his disciples. Most of them were perplexed, but Kasyapa smiled and the Buddha handed him the flower, as if he had understood something that everyone else had missed. To this day it remains a mystery what it was that the Buddha communicated to Kasyapa, but everyone treats the story as if it is of pivotal importance.

草	grass				cǎo	0213	10		Perhaps you know the custom of seeding grass randomly or in some particular pattern with the flower called the crocus, which blooms for a few days each year in early spring. As the grass begins to turn green again after winter has passed, these tiny flowers dot up here and there. Now just look out your window at a patch of grass somewhere and think what a nice idea it would be to have your name spelled out in flowers once as a sort of early harbinger of spring.

苦	Suffering				kǔ	0214	9		The picture of suffering we are given here is that of a flower that has grown ancient. When a flower ages, it pales and dries up, and probably even endures a kind of botanical suffering. If<br />you think that plants are incapable of such feelings, then ask yourself why so many people believe that talking to their flow­ers helps them bloom better.

寬	wide				kuān	0215	15		The key word wide will suggest a wide-angle lens, since that is one of the first expressions likely to pop into mind at the sound of the word. What we are trying to see in a single view is an immense greenhouse filled with one each of all the flow­ers of the world. Picture yourself trying to see the whole thing through the viewer of your wide-angle lens, and then focusing on a single drop of dew on the tiniest petal of the tiniest blos­som. To see everything in all its detail may be asking a little much of a single lens, but nothing short of such a vision could ever satisfy the curiosity that comes with the gift of sight.

莫	nobody		When this character is used as a primitive element, we will replace the abstract key word with the more concrete <i>graveyard</i>.		mò	0217	11		"A rickety old sign with the warning written on it ""Nobody, but Nobody Leaves Here"" dangles from a shingle over the entrance to a graveyard. But, contrary to what you expect, this is a thoroughly modern graveyard. Gone are the cobwebs and gnarled trees, the tilted headstones and dark, moonless nights that used to scare the wits out of our childhood imaginations. Instead, we see brightly colored flowers placed before the tombstones, the sun shining gloriously overhead, and a cuddly St Bernard dog sitting at the gate, making sure that nobody tries to leave.

漠	Desert				mò	0219	14		Let this key word suggest to you a mirage in a desert. The haze rising up from the desert sands creates the illusion of a body of water in the distance. In fact, the mirage only recedes as you crawl your way across the surface of what will soon be your graveyard. To fix the image, imagine yourself reaching the mirage and finding out that it is in fact a graveyard, in which there is a headstone with your name on it.

墓	a Grave				mù	0220	14		The mounds of soil with crude wooden crosses set at their head suggests those Boot Hill graves near Tombstone, Arizona, that many of you will remember from cowboy lore. The only odd thing about this character is that the soil comes under the graveyard, rather than to its left, where we might expect it. Just think of how it looks as you walk toward Boot Hill, with the cross and mound of soil in the foreground.<br />By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a character whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape dif­fers somewhat. There is no cause to worry. By using the primi­tive in a variety of other characters, as we have done here, the confusion will be averted as a matter of course. In most cases, as here, the primitive element is simply one part of the fuller original character.

桃	peach				táo	0224	10		To associate the peach with the primitive for a portent, recall the famous Japanese legend of Momotaro, the Peach Boy. It begins once upon a time with a fisherman and his wife who wanted badly to have a child, but none was born to them. Then one day the old man caught a giant peach, out of which jumped a healthy young lad whom they named Peach Boy. Though the boy was destined to perform heroic deeds, his birth foreshad­owed great misfortune (how else could he become a hero?). Thus the peach tree is seen as a portent of coming evil.

The image of logic we are given is something like a central jewel in a computer, like the jewels in old clocks that keep them running smoothly.

Anyway, we want to depict bars of gold bullion with an umbrella overhead to shade them from the heat (and perhaps to hide them as well). The bullion is made by melting down all the scepters of the kingdom, drop by drop, and shaping them into bars.

鎮	at ease				zhèn	0267	18		The first lie-detector machines of the twentieth century worked by wiring pieces of metal to the body to measure the amount of sweat produced when questions were asked. It was discov­ered that nervousness produced more sweat, indicating subcon­scious reactions when the true facts of the matter were getting too close for comfort. The only way to beat the apparatus is to have complete control over yourself and remain perfectly at ease. Picture yourself trying to do it while the examiners ask questions guaranteed to extract buckets of sweat from you.

道	Way				dào	0268	12		The key word carries both the sense of a road or way for transit and a way or method of doing something. The primitives here read: heads and road. YouVe probably heard about companies cleaning house and threatening that &quot;heads are going to roll.&quot; Well, here is the road they are rolling on.

造	to create				zào	0271	10		We sometimes think of create as meaning to make something out of nothing. Most of the time, however, there is something there to begin with, and often what is created doesn't amount to much of an improvement. Like politicians invoking the right of eminent domain to declare that a road will be built across the farmland that has been in your family for two hundred years.

戈	Halberd		"❖ When this character is used as a primitive, we will revert to a friendler meaning.

茂	lush				mào	0340	9		The sense of the key word lush is that of something growing luxuriously, though not necessarily in excess-in this case a whole parade of weeds (outcast flowers).

Now as the song reminds us, &quot;Everybody needs some­body sometime.&quot; Here, quite literally, the marching mouths are desperately in need of some body. (For that matter, everyBODY needs a mouth.) Imagine them singing the song and you should feel a twinge of pity that will stick this character in memory.

止	to stop		❖ Although the meaning of stop will be retained, we will return often to the pictographic meaning of footprint. When the last two strokes are moved to look like this At, it means a whole trail of footprints, as you might find on the beach. We will not see an example of this until frame 973.		zhǐ	0353	4		The character for stop is easiest to learn as a pictograph, though you have to take a moment to see it. Take it as a rather crude drawing of a footprint, the track that is left when your foot has stopped long enough to make an impression. The first three strokes represent the front of the foot and the last one, the heel. The big toe (the second stroke sticking out to the right) indi­cates that this is a left foot. [4]			止		to stop, halt, prohibit	YLM	035300		RTH RTH1
步	Footstep(s)				bù	0354	7		Footprints that follow one another a few at a time indicate foot­steps.

涉	to ford				shè	0355	10		One way to ford a body of water is to wade across it on foot You need to take your footsteps one after the other, but unlike a stroll on dry land, you have to be careful to keep your balance and not end up in the water. Remember what is feels like to walk gingerly on the slippery bottom of a shallow stream, calculating your every footstep as you go.

頻	repeatedly				pín	0356	16		The image of something occurring repeatedly, over and over again, is of having ones head walked on, a succession of foot­steps trampling on your cranium.

武	military				wǔ	0360	8		Think of the 24-hour clock, also known as &quot;military time,&quot; as a watch face whose numbers actually go from 1 to 24, but which has only the hour hand on it (the elements for one and arrow), due to cutbacks in military expenditure. Now all you have to do is find a way to introduce the element that can mean either stop or footprint Be sure to retain a military flavor in your image.

賦	Levy				fù	0361	15		A levy can be imposed for any number of reasons, but here it is pictured as a certain number of clams (money) collected by the powers that be to offset current military expenses—presumably so they can get back the minute hand for watches like the one in the last frame.

Here we see one footprint, complement­ing that proverb with the sound advice that if the first step is not correct, the rest of the journey will be off track. This is the ideal that teachers are supposed to have in correcting their stu­dents, and parents in correcting their children. [5]"			正		right, proper, correct; to correct	MYLM	036200		RTH RTH1
政	Politics				zhèng	0363	9		To the many definitions for politics that already exist, this char­acter offers yet another: correct taskmastering.

走	to walk				zǒu	0365	7		To walk, we are told here, has the effect of mending the soil. If you consider what driving an automobile over the soil does to it, taking more time off to walk might not be a bad idea.<br>Note that the final stroke of soil doubles up with the first stroke of mending. Of course, you could also use soil and trail of footprints as the primitive elements, but if you do, youre on your own. [7]			走		to walk, move; to go, leave	GYO	036500		RTH RTH1
超	to transcend				chāo	0366	12		Things that are beneath us tempt us to be satisfied with less than we are capable of. It is the things that transcend us that summon us to walk the path to a higher state.<br />Note in this and the following frame how the element for walk can embrace other elements from below, much the same way as the element for road does. In order to do this, the final stroke needs to be lengthened.

越	to surpass				yuè	0367	12		Here we see two parades in competition, each trying to surpass the other by walking at breakneck pace from one town to the next. Note the little &quot;hook&quot; at the end of the first stroke of the element for parade. This is the only time it appears like this in the characters treated in these books.

誕	Nativity				dàn	0372	15		The key word, of course, calls to mind the feast of Christmas. As the famous poem at the start of St. John's gospel tells us, the nativity we celebrate at Christmas had its origins at the very start of time and governs all of human history. Celebrating the nativity prolongs the memory of the eternal Word in time and space. [15]			诞		birth; birthday; bear children, give birth	YRNKM, YRNKV	037200		RTH RTH1

礎	Foundation				chǔ	0374	18		This character depicts a cornerstone, which was not—as it is today—a decorative slab of marble set in a corner of a finished building.

In fact, it is the most volatile of all the charac­ters we shall treat, and for that reason we will assign distinct meanings to each of the variant shapes.<br />When it appears to the left, it looks like this: 衤 and we shall generally take it to mean a cloak or cape. At the bot­tom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the top hat) are omitted, giving us: A, which we shall take to mean a scarf.<br />On rare occasions, the final four strokes are drawn with the first two strokes slightly repositioned to give us JOc. We will refer to this element as a bandana. An example will not show up until frame 610.<br />Occasionally the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first two strokes appearing at the top and the last four at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitives: in which cases we shall speak of a top hat and scarf.<br />And finally, of course, the element can keep its original character shape, along with its original meaning of clothing in general.		yī	0375	6		At the top we see the top hat, and at the bottom a pictographic representation of the folds of a piece of clothing. If you break the four folds into two sets of two strokes, you will find it easier to remember the character for clothing. [6]			衣		clothes	YHV	037500		RTH RTH1

袁	Yuan		Long robe		yuán	0378	10		It is used today as a family name, well illustrated by Yuan Shikai (1859-1916).

壞	bad				huài	0380	19		When we introduced the character for water back in frame 126, we noted that one of its primitive element shapes (to which we assigned the meaning snowflake) often appears one way in block print and another in handwritten or calligraphic form. Here we see an example of just that. There are a lot of elements to work with here in creating a story for bad. It begins with dirt and passes on to the top hat and scarf which sandwiches two more elements: eyeball and snowflake. Now, while some people have the capacity to find something good in everything, here we see a pessimistic aristocrat (in top hat and scarf) with his eyeball fixed on a snowflake and looking for the tiniest speck of dirt in it to satisfy his macabre view of reality.

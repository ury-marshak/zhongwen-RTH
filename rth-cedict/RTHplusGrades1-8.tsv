吾	I&nbsp;&nbsp;[literary]			wú	0018	7	There are a number of characters for the word <b>I</b>, but this one is restricted to literary use in Chinese. We need a sufficiently stuffy connotation for the key word, for which the sense of a &quot;perceiving subject&quot; should do just fine. Now the one place in our bodies that all <i>five</i> senses are concentrated in is the head, which has no less than <i>five</i> <i>mouths</i>: 2 nostrils, 2 ears, and 1 mouth. Hence, <i>five mouths</i> = <b>I</b>. [7]			吾		I; my; our (ie: royal &quot;we&quot;)
朋	Companion			péng	0019	8	"The first <b>companion</b> that God made, as the Bible story goes, was Eve. Upon seeing her, Adam is said to have exclaimed, ""<i>Flesh</i> of my <i>flesh</i>"" And that is precisely what this character says in so many strokes. [8]"			朋		friend, pal, acquaintance
明	bright			míng	0020	8	Among nature's <b>bright</b> lights, there are two that the biblical story of creation has God set in the sky: the <i>sun</i> to rule over the day and the <i>moon</i> to rule the night. Each of them has come to represent one of the common connotations of this key word: the sun, the <b>bright</b> insight of the clear thinker, and the moon, the <b>bright</b> intuition of the poet and the seer. [8]		(1368-1644 :major system: Dam+Shiva - a DJ+Aurora)	明		bright, clear; to understand (明白; míngbái); ALSO: the Ming dynasty
唱	to sing			chàng	0021	11	This one is easy! You have one <i>mouth</i> making no noise (the choirmaster) and two <i>mouths with wagging tongues</i> (the minimum for a chorus). So when you hear the key word <b>sing</b>, think of the Vienna Boys' Choir or the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the character is yours forever (see frame 12). [11]			唱		to sing; to chant
晶	sparkling			jīng	0022	12	"What else can the word <b>sparkling</b> suggest if not a diamond? And if you've ever held a diamond up to the light, you will have noticed how every facet of it becomes like a miniature <i>sun</i>. This character is a picture of a tiny <i>sun</i> in three places (that is, ""everywhere""), to give the sense of something <b>sparkling</b> all over the place. Just like a diamond. In writing the primitive elements three times, note again how the rule for writing given in frame 4 holds true not only for the strokes in each individual element but also for the disposition of the elements in the character as a whole. [12]"	(not <i>shining</i>)		晶		crystal, sparkling, bright, radiant
品	Goods			pǐn	0023	9	"As in the character for <i>sparkling</i>, the triplication of a single element in this character indicates ""everywhere"" or ""heaps of."" When we think of <b>goods</b> in modern industrial society, we think of what has been mass-produced―that is to say, produced for the ""masses"" of open <i>mouths</i> waiting like fledglings in a nest to ""consume"" whatever comes their way. [9]"			品		article, product, commodity
昌	prosperous			chāng	0024	8	What we mentioned in the previous two frames about three of something meaning &quot;everywhere&quot; or &quot;heaps of&quot; was not meant to be taken lightly. In this character we see two <i>suns</i>, one atop the other, which, if we are not careful, is easily confused in memory with the three <i>suns</i> of <i>sparkling</i>. Focus on the number this way: since we speak of <b>prosperous</b> times as <i>sunny</i>, what could be more prosperous than a sky with two <i>suns</i> in it? Just be sure to actually see them there. [8]			昌		prosperous; flourishing
早	early		As a primitive element, this character takes the meaning of <i>sunflower</i>, which was used to make the abstract key word <i>early</i> more graphic.	zǎo	0025	6	This character is actually a picture of the first flower of the day, which we shall, in defiance of botanical science, call the <i>sun</i>-flower, since it begins with the element for <i>sun</i> and is held up on a stem with leaves (the pictographic representation of the final two strokes). This time, however, we shall ignore the pictograph and imagine <i>sun</i>flowers with <i>needles</i> for stems, which can be plucked and used to darn your socks. The sense of <b>early</b> is easily remembered if one thinks of the <i>sun</i>flower as the <b>early</b> riser in the garden, because the <i>sun</i>, showing favoritism towards its namesake, shines on it before all the others (see frame 10). [6]			早		early; morning; for a long time, as early as ...
旭	Rising Sun			xù	0026	6	The key word here immediately suggests the islands located to the east of China, which would make it, from China's point of view, the Land of the <b>Rising Sun</b>, a name easily associated with Japan's national flag. If you can picture two seams running down that great red <i>sun</i>, and then imagine it sitting on a <i>baseball</i> bat for a flagpole, you have a slightly irreverent―but not altogether inaccurate―picture of how the sport has caught on in the Land of the <b>Rising Sun</b>. [6]			旭		dawn; the rising sun
世	Generation			shì	0027	5	"We generally consider one <b>generation</b> as a period of thirty (or <i>ten</i> plus <i>ten</i> plus <i>ten</i>) years. If you look at this character in its completed form―not in its stroke order―you will see three <i>tens</i>. When writing it, think of the lower horizontal lines as ""addition"" lines written under numbers to add them up. Thus: <i>ten</i> ""plus"" <i>ten</i> ""plus"" <i>ten</i> = thirty. Actually, it's a lot easier doing it with a pencil than reading it in a book. [5]"			世		generation, age, era; lifetime
胃	Stomach			wèi	0028	9	"You will need to refer back to frames 13 and 14 here for the special meaning of the two primitive elements that make up this character: <i>brain</i> and <i>flesh (part of the body)</i>. What the character says, if you look at it, is that the <i>part of the body</i> that keeps the <i>brain</i> in working order is the <b>stomach</b>. To keep the elements in proper order, when you write this character think of the <i>brain</i> as being ""held up"" by the <i>flesh</i>. [9]"			胃		stomach, belly, paunch
旦	Daybreak			dàn	0029	5	The obvious sign of <b>daybreak</b> is the <i>sun</i> peeking out over the horizon, which is pretty much what this character depicts. If you can imagine the <i>sun</i> poking its head out through a hole in your <i>floor</i>, however, you will have an easier time remembering this character. [5]			旦		dawn, morning, day-break
凹	concave			āo	0030	5	You couldn't have asked for a better key word for this character! Just have a look at it: a perfect image of a concave lens (remembering, of course, that the characters square off rounded things), complete with its own little &quot;cave.&quot; Now all you have to do is learn how to write it. [5]			凹		concave, indented or depressed, sunken
凸	convex			tū [普], tú [國]	0031	5	Maybe this helps you see how the Chinese have no trouble keeping <b>convex</b> distinct from <i>concave</i>. Note the odd feeling of the fourth stroke. If it doesn't feel all that strange now, by the time you are done with this book, it will. There are very few times you will have to write it. [5]			凸		convex, protruding; bulge out
自	oneself		The same meaning of <i>oneself</i> can be kept when this character is used as a primitive element, but you will generally find it better to give it the meaning of <i>nose</i> or <i>nostrils</i>, both because it accords with the story above and because it is the first part of the character for <i>nose</i> (frame 575).	zì	0032	6	You can think of this character as a stylized pictograph of the nose, that little <i>drop</i> that Mother Nature set between your <i>eyes</i>. The Chinese often refer to themselves by pointing a finger at their nose―giving us an easy way to remember the character for <b>oneself</b>. [6]	(not self)		自		oneself, self; personal
白	white		As a primitive, this character can either retain its meaning of <i>white</i> or take the more graphic meaning of a <i>white bird</i> or <i>dove</i>. This stems from the fact that it appears at the top of the character for <i>bird</i>, which we shall get to later (frame 1396).	bái	0033	5	The color <b>white</b> is a mixture of all the primary colors, both for pigments and for light, as we see when a prism breaks up the rays of the <i>sun</i>. Hence, a single <i>drop</i> of <i>sun</i> spells <b>white</b>. [5]			白		white, pure, unblemished; clear, plain
百	hundred			bǎi	0034	6	"When the Japanese borrowed the Chinese characters, they often played with their shapes to find interesting connections. For example, they came to refer to a person's 99th birthday as the start of the ""<i>white</i> year"" because <i>white</i> is the character you are left with if you subtract <i>one</i> from a <b>hundred</b>. [6]"			百		hundred; numerous
皂	Soap			zào	0035	7	Whatever the color of the <b>soap</b> that this character refers to, it does the same trick of <i>cutting</i> the grease and grime to make things <i>white</i>. That's a bit too abstract and reasonable, though, so you may want to imagine looking at the soap under a microscope and seeing little whirling blades <i>dicing</i> the blotches of dirt one by one until everything turns <i>white</i>. [7]			皂		soap; black
中	Middle			zhōng	0036	4	"The elements in this character are a <i>walking stick</i> and a <i>mouth</i>. The connotation we will associate with the key word <b>middle</b> is that period of life known as <b>middle</b> age, so called because it is the time in your life when you have trouble with your expanding ""<b>middle</b>."" More often than not, the expansion has to do with eating more and moving around less. This character has the<br />grotesque image of a person with a <i>walking stick</i> jammed into his <i>mouth</i>, the more easily to shovel food in without the interference of the tedious exercise of opening and closing it. [4]<br />Note the indicator that the character for <b>middle</b> can be used as either a noun or an adjective. Where no part of speech is indicated, assume the most common. In the case of the former frame, for example, <i>soap</i> might be taken as a verb, but one's first thought goes to the noun, which is a good place to start for that character. Be aware, though, that even where one part of speech is indicated for a character, other possibilities may exist."			中		center, middle; central; in the midst of; ALSO: China
千	thousand			qiān	0037	3	This character is almost too simple to pull apart, but for the sake of practice, have a look at the <i>eyedropper</i> above and the <i>ten</i> below. Now put the elements together by thinking of squeezing two more zeros out of an eyedropper alongside the number <i>ten</i> to make it a <b>thousand</b>. [3]			千		thousand; a multitude
舌	Tongue			shé	0038	6	"The characters for <i>mouth</i> and <i>thousand</i> naturally form the idea of <b>tongue</b> if one thinks of a <i>thousand</i> <i>mouths</i> able to speak the same language, or as we say, ""sharing a common <b>tongue</b>."" It is easy to see the connection between the idiom and the character if you take its image literally: a single <b>tongue</b> being passed around from <i>mouth</i> to <i>mouth</i>. [6]"			舌		tongue
升	Liter			shēng	0039	4	Think of a one-<b>liter</b> carafe (the kind you might serve drinks in) filled not with milk or wine but with a <i>thousand</i> sharp <i>needles</i>. You may well wonder what they are doing there, but the answer is simple: it's a kind of sports drink for a robot. [4]			升		metric liter MW (also written 公升; gōngshēng)
昇	to rise up			shēng	0040	8	Keeping the image from the last frame, we have here a <i>liter</i> carafe with a <i>sun</i> above it. Conveniently, the connotation of the key word <b>rise up</b> is what the <i>sun</i> does in the morning, just before breakfast. Can you actually SEE it <b>rising up</b> out of the <i>liter</i> carafe of freshly squeezed <i>Sun</i>kist orange juice on your breakfast table? [8]			升		to raise, hoist; promote; ascend
丸	Pill		As a primitive, this element takes the meaning of a <i>bottle of pills</i>.	wán	0041	3	One of the scourges of sports like modern baseball has been the use of performance-enhancing drugs, those tiny little pills that have helped turn honest competition into cut-throat business. Now look at the character and picture it as a bottle of pills hanging on the thigh of a baseball player like a pez dispenser, ready for the popping as the need arises. [3]			丸		pill, pellet, small round object; ball
卜	Divination		When using this character as a primitive, we will stick with the meaning of a <i>divining rod</i> or a <i>magic wand</i>.	bǔ	0042	2				卜		fortune telling; prophesy; to divine; foretell
占	to tell fortunes			zhān	0043	5	This is one of those characters that is a real joy of simplicity: a <i>divining rod</i> with a <i>mouth</i> ― which are the two ingredients needed to <b>tell fortunes</b>. Note how the movement from top to bottom (the movement in which the characters are written) is also the order of the elements which make up our story and of the key word itself: first <i>divining rod</i>, then <i>mouth</i>. This will not always be possible, but where it is, memory has almost no work at all to do. [5]			占		to divine; practice divination
上	above			shàng	0044	3	"The two directions, <b>above</b> and <i>below</i>, are usually pointed at with the finger. But the characters do not follow that custom, so we have to choose something else, easily remembered. The primitives show a <i>magic wand</i> standing <b>above</b> a <i>floor</i> ― ""magically,"" you might say. Anyway, go right on to the next frame, since the two belong together and are best remembered as a unit, just as the words <b>above</b> and <i>below</i> suggest each other. [3]"			上		top, superior, above, highest; to go up, forge ahead
下	below			xìa	0045	3	Here we see our famous <i>magic wand</i> hanging, all on its own, <b>below</b> the <i>ceiling</i>, as you probably already guessed would happen. In addition to giving us two new characters, the two shapes in this and the preceding frame also serve to illustrate the difference between the primitive meanings for <i>ceiling</i> and <i>floor</i>: it all depends on whether the single horizontal line stands above or <b>below</b> the primitive element to which it is related. [3]			下		under, underneath, below, down; inferior; to bring down
卡	Card			kǎ	0046	5	The key word <b>card</b> can stand for all sorts of things, but let's settle on a credit <b>card</b> for our image. Perhaps the first thing that comes to mind is the picture of a shopkeeper sliding your credit <b>card</b> up and down (from <i>above</i> to <i>below</i> and back again) in the reading machine to record your transaction. Now imagine her doing it fast and furiously, again and again, with increasing impatience until your poor <b>card</b> is whittled away to a small strip of plastic. [5]	(credit card)		卡		card, punch card
卓	eminent			zhuó	0047	8	The word <b>eminent</b> suggests a famous or well-known person. So all you need to do―given the primitives of a <i>magic wand</i> and a <i>sunflower</i> ― is to think of the world's most <b>eminent</b> magician as one who uses a <i>sunflower</i> for a <i>magic wand</i> (like a flower-child who goes around turning the world into peace and love). [8]			卓		profound, eminent, lofty
朝	Dynasty			cháo	0048	12	It is easy to imagine one of the great <b>dynasties</b> of China in all its glory. Now all we have to figure out is what the elements <i>moon</i> and <i>mist</i> have to do with it. Picture a great palace with a powerful emperor seated on a throne in its innermost court. To keep the Wizard-of-Oz illusion that this power is beyond question and beyond the understanding of the masses, the whole complex is kept permanently shrouded in <i>mist</i>. How do they do it, you ask. On one side of the throne is a servant pulling on a cord to wave a gigantic fan back and forth. On the other, a servant with a long cord hooked on a corner of the quarter <i>moon</i>. When he pulls on it, the <i>moon</i> tilts over and spills out a month's supply of <i>mist</i> that keeps the myth of the dynasty alive. [12]			朝		dynasty, imperial court; ALSO: Korea<br>towards<br>to face<br>facing<br>direct<br>a dynasty<br>the imperial court<br>open to
嘲	to ridicule			cháo	0049	15	"If you read off the elements in the character, you have something like ""<i>mouthing</i> off at the <i>dynasty</i>!"" When we think of what we commonly <b>ridicule</b> in civilized society, one of the oldest and most universal targets is the ruling elite. Who better to deride than one's leaders? Again, the explanation is too rational, so turn it into a story that has you <b>ridiculing</b> a particular <i>dynasty</i>'s court with particular buffoonery. [15]"	(not&nbsp;<i>to mock</i>)		嘲		to ridicule, mock, deride, scorn
只	only			zhǐ	0050	5	"When we run across abstract key words like this one, the best<br>way to get an image is to recall some common but suggestive<br>phrase in which the word appears. For instance, we can think<br>of the expression ""it's the only one of its kind."" Then we imagine<br>a barker at a side-show advertising some strange pac-man like<br>creature he has inside his tent, with only a gigantic mouth and<br>two wee animal legs. [5]"			只		only, merely, just, but
貝	Shellfish		When this character is used as a primitive, in addition to <i>shellfish</i>, the meanings <i>shells</i>, <i>oysters</i>, and <i>clams</i> will often come in handy.	bèi	0051	7	To remember the primitive elements that make up this charac-<br />ter, an <i>eye</i> and <i>animal legs</i>, you might be tempted to think of it<br />as a pictograph of a <b>shellfish</b> with its ridged shell at the top and<br />two little <i>legs</i> sticking out of the bottom. But that might not help<br />you recall later just how many ridges to put on the shell. Better<br />to imagine a freakish <b>shellfish</b> with a single, gigantic <i>eye</i> roam-<br />ing the beaches on its slender little <i>legs</i>, scaring the wits out of<br />the sunbathers. [7]		note: never right side	贝		shellfish; sea shell; money
貼	to paste			tiē	0052	12	Think here of brushing on an adhesive, as when you paste<br />something on a billboard. Here we have an oyster pasting a<br />poster on his back to advertise his services in the dubious occu-<br />pation of one who tells fortunes. Try to imagine the problem<br />he would have reaching his back with the brush to paste, and<br />then see him strutting around and calling out, &quot;Fortunes to tell!<br />Fortunes to tell!&quot; [12]			贴		to paste to, stick on, glue; attached to
貞	chaste			zhēn	0053	9	You have heard of Diogenes running around with his lamp<br />looking for an honest man. Here we have an image of the<br />famous shellfish, Oysterogenes, running around with his divin-<br />ing rod looking for a chaste man. We leave it to you to decide<br />which one has the better luck in his quest. [9]		//clamshell around penis//	贞		virtuous, chaste, pure; loyal
員	Employee			yuán	0054	10	How do we get a mouth over a shellfish to mean an employee?<br />Simple. Just remember the advice new employees get about<br />keeping their mouths shut and doing their jobs, and then make<br />that more graphic by picturing an office building full of white-<br />collar workers scurrying around with clams pinched to their<br />mouths. [10]			员		employee, assistant; personnel, staff member
見	to see			jiàn	0055	7	The elements that compose the character for see are the eye<br />firmly fixed to a pair of human legs. Surely, somewhere in your<br />experience, there is a vivid image just waiting to be dragged up<br />to help you remember this character.... [7]			见		see, observe, behold; percieve
元	Beginning			yuán	0056	4	"""In the beginning..."" starts that marvelous shelf of books we<br />call the Bible. It talks about how all things were made, and tells<br />us that when it came to humanity the Creator made two of<br />them, man and woman. While we presume two were made of<br />every other creature as well, we are not told as much. Hence we<br />need only two and a pair of human legs to come to the character<br />that means beginning. [4]"	(<u>not</u> <i>to begin</i>)		元		origin; first, primary; dollar; ALSO: Yuan dynasty
頁	Page		As a primitive, this character often takes the unrelated meaning of a <i>head </i>(preferably one detached from its body), derived from the character for <i>head </i>(frame 1067).	yè	0057	9	"What we have to do here is turn a shellfish into a page of a book.<br>The one at the top tells us that we only get a rather short book,<br>in fact a book of only one page. Imagine a title printed on the<br>shell of an oyster, let us say ""Pearl of Wisdom,"" and then open<br>the quaint book to its one and only page, on which you find a<br>single, radiant drop of wisdom, one of the masterpiece poems of<br>nature. [9]"			页		page; leaf
頑	stubborn			wán	0058	13	This character refers to a blockhead, a persistently stubborn<br />person who sticks to an idea or a plan just the way it was at the<br />beginning, without letting anything that comes up along the way<br />alter things in the least. The explanation makes &quot;sense,&quot; but is<br />hard to remember because the word &quot;beginning&quot; is too abstract.<br />Back up to the image we used two frames ago―Adam and Eve<br />in their Eden―and try again: The root of all this goes back to<br />the beginning, with two brothers each defending his own way<br />of life and asking their God to bless it favorably. Abel stuck to<br />agriculture, Cain to animal-raising. Picture these two seeking<br />the favors of heaven, one of them with an unusually stubborn<br />grimace on his face. No wonder something unfortunate hap-<br />pened! [13]			顽		obstinate, stubborn; recalcitrant
凡	ordinary			fán	0059	3	"While we refer to something insignificant as a ""drop in the<br />bucket,"" the character for ordinary shows us a ""drop in the<br />wind"" To make the image stick as clearly as water dropping into<br />a bucket, stop and think of something really ordinary and then<br />say, ""It's just a drop in the wind""―and imagine what that might<br />actually look like. [3]"			凡		ordinary, common, mundane
肌	Muscle			jī	0060	6	One of the more common ways of testing the strength of one's<br />muscles is to lock hands with a local hulk on a small table top<br />and arm wrestle. This is the image here, depicted by the ele-<br />ments for part of the body and small table. The muscle is, there-<br />fore, the part of the body you test by literally bringing it to the<br />small table. [6]	(full character)		肌		flesh; muscle
負	defeated			fù	0061	9	Above we have the condensed form of bound up, and below, the<br>familiar shellfish. Now imagine two oysters engaged in shell-to-<br>shell combat, the one who is defeated being bound and gagged<br>with seaweed, the victor towering triumphantly over it. The<br>bound shellfish thus becomes the symbol for anyone or any-<br>thing that has been defeated. [9]			负		to lose; to be burdened; negative (math)
勻	uniform			yún	0062	4	The two primitives bound up and two (clearer in the hand-<br />drawn form) combine to give the meaning of uniform. One<br />of the real challenges for primary school teachers is to keep<br />students from scattering every which direction. If you think<br />of the final touch to a school outfit, the shoes, and then recall<br />the childhood jingle, &quot;One, two, buckle my shoe,&quot; the solution<br />is near at hand. Instead of having children buckle their shoes,<br />they can be taught to tie their shoelaces together by changing<br />the lyrics to read &quot;One, two, bind up my shoes.&quot; This keeps them<br />from straying very far from the group and helps teachers pro-<br />vide a uniform education. [4]			匀		equal; evenly (divided); uniform
句	Sentence			jù	0063	5	By combining the two primitives bound up and mouth, it is easy<br>to see how this character can have the meaning of a sentence.<br>The mouth suggests it is a spoken sentence. To be more precise,<br>it is a cluster of words bound up tightly and neatly so that they<br>will fit in your mouth. [5]			句		sentence, phrase, clause; MW for verse
旬	Decameron			xún	0064	6	There simply is not a good phrase in English for the block of ten<br />days which this character represents. So we resurrect the classi-<br />cal term decameron, whose connotations the tales of Boccaccio<br />have done much to enrich. Actually, it refers to a journey of<br />ten days taken by a band of people―that is, a group of people<br />bound together for the days of the decameron. [6]			旬		a ten-day period
勺	Ladle		If you want to bind up drops of anything―water, soup, lemon-<br>ade―you use something to scoop these drops up, which is what<br>we call a ladle. See the last drop left inside the ladle? [3]	sháo	0065	3				勺		spoon, ladle; (unit of volume = 10 ml)
的	Bull’s Eye			de	0066	8	"The elements white bird and ladle easily suggest the image of<br>a bull's eye if you imagine a rusty old ladle with a bull's eye<br>painted on it in the form of a tiny white bird, who lets out a little<br>""peep"" every time you hit the target.<br>This is the most frequently used character in Chinese, serv-<br>ing a number of common grammatical functions. But―it also<br>means bull's eye. [8]"			的		"[possessive marker]; as (dì) = ""aim"""
首	Heads			shǒu	0067	9	Reading this character from the top down, we have: horns ...<br>nose. Together they bring to mind the picture of a moose-head<br>hanging on the den wall, with its great horns and long nose. The<br>plural form is used to stress the frequent metaphorical use of<br>the term to refer to various kinds of heads, including heads of<br>state. It might help to see a number of the latter lined up on the<br>den wall alongside the moose, each fitted out with antlers and a<br>whopper of a nose.<br>Here we get a good look at what we mentioned when we first<br>introduced the element for horns: that they can never be left<br>floating free and require an extra horizontal stroke to prevent<br>that from happening, as is the case here. [9]			首		head, chief, leader; first (occasion or thing); MW for poems
直	straight			zhí	0068	8	Think of the first two elements, ten eyes, as referring to a group<br>of five scientists working together on a top-secret, million-<br>dollar project to draw a straight line on the floor without the<br>aid of special equipment. In the end, all ten eyes verify that it<br>is straight, leaving no doubt that the use of government funds<br>was fully justified. Time to apply for another grant.<br>Note how the first two strokes of the element for eye are made<br>a little longer so that they can touch the final stroke. The same<br>thing will happen in the following three characters, and later on<br>as well, so pay particular attention to the stroke order below. [8]			直		straight, vertical, upright, erect; frank, candid
置	to set up			zhì	0069	13	Think of having to set up the net for a badminton or volleyball<br>game. One of the main problems is how to keep the net in a<br>straight line so that it doesn't sag in the middle. Which is just<br>what this character shows us. [13]			置		place, arrange, lay out; set aside
具	Tool			jù	0070	8	Here is the full character on which the primitive of the last<br />frame is based. If you can think of a table full of carpenter's<br />tools of all sorts, each equipped with its own eye so that it can<br />keep a watch over what you are doing with it, you won't have<br />trouble later keeping the primitive and the character apart. [8]			具		tool, instrument, device; equipment
真	true			zhēn	0071	10	Here is an example of how there can be different ways of identi-<br />fying the primitive elements that make up a character. The most<br />obvious is straight and animal legs, but the character could as<br />well be analyzed into ten and tool. Let's choose the latter.<br />How do you know if something is true or not? What if there<br />were a kit of ten tools you could count on to run a test? Well, at<br />least when it comes to asking whether people are really true to<br />themselves, the ten commandments are a good start. [10]<br />			真		real, true, actual, genuine
工	the Work		Since the key word can be too abstract when used as a primitive element, we will often revert to the clearer image of an <i>I-beam</i>.	gōng	0072	3	The pictograph of an I-beam, like the kind that is used in heavy<br>construction work on buildings and bridges, gives us the char-<br>acter for work. [3]			工		work, labor, worker; working class; skill, (cp: 唱工; chànggōng; the art of singing)
左	Left			zuǒ	0073	5	"By combining the last two frames and reading the results, we<br>get: by ones side... work. Conveniently, the left has traditionally<br>been considered the ""sinister"" side, where dark and occult works<br>are cultivated and carried out. [5]"			左		left, lefthand; unorthodox, improper; leftwing
右	Right			yòu	0074	5	"When thinking of the key word right, in order to avoid con-<br>fusion with the previous frame, take advantage of the double<br>meaning here. Imagine a little mouth hanging down by one's<br>side―one's right side, of course―like a little voice of conscience<br>telling one the ""right"" thing to do. [5]"			右		right, righthand; rightwing
有	to possess			yǒu	0075	6	The picture here is a slab of flesh dangling by one's side, perhaps<br>from a belt or rope tied around the waist. While we normally<br>think of things that we have and possess, we also know that<br>there are things that can have and possess us. Such cases might<br>be likened to an evil spirit possessing one's soul. This character<br>suggests a way to exorcize it: hang a slab of fresh flesh by one's<br>side until it begins to putrefy and stink so bad that the demon<br>departs. Take careful note of the stroke order. [6]			有		have, own, possess; exist
賄	bribe			huì	0076	13	To the left we have the primitive for a shellfish, and to the right,<br />the character we just learned for possess. Keep the connotation<br />of the last frame for the word possess, and now expand your<br />image of shells to include the ancient value they had as money<br />(a usage that will come in very helpful later on). Now people<br />who are possessed by shells are likely to abandon any higher<br />principles to acquire more and more wealth. These are the easi-<br />est ones to persuade with a bribe of a few extra shells. [13]<br />			贿		bribe; to offer a bribe
貢	Tribute			gòng	0077	10	A tribute has a kind of double meaning in English: honor paid<br />freely and money (shells) collected by coercion. Simply because<br />a ruler bestows a noble name on a deed is hardly any consola-<br />tion to the masses who must part with their hard-earned shells.<br />Little wonder that this ancient work of gathering money by call-<br />ing it a tribute has given way to a name closer to how it feels to<br />those who pay it: a tax. [10]<br />			贡		tribute, gifts
項	Item			xiàng	0078	12	"To the right we see a page and to the left an element for I-beam.<br />The item referred to here is not some specific object but an<br />entry on an ""itemized"" list. Each item in the list you have to<br />imagine here is preceded by a little I-beam―not a drawing, but<br />an actual iron I-beam. Imagine lugging a list like that around<br />the grocery store! [12]<br />"			项		item, thing; sum (of money)
刀	Sword		In the form of the character, this primitive means a <i>dagger</i>. When it appears to the right of another element, it is commonly stretched out like this 刂, and like this 'J when to the left of another element. In these cases, it will take the sense of a great and flashing <i>saber</i>, a meaning it gets from a character to be introduced in Book 2.	dāo	0079	2	Although this character no longer looks very much like a sword,<br />it does have some resemblance to the handle of the sword. As<br />it turns out, this is to our advantage, in that it helps us make a<br />distinction between two primitive elements based on this char-<br />acter. [2]<br />			刀		knife, dagger
刃	Blade			rèn	0080	3	Think of using a dagger as a razor blade, and it shouldn't be<br>hard to imagine cutting yourself. See the little drop of blood<br>dripping off the blade? [3]			刃		blade; edge of blade
切	to cut			qiē	0081	4	To the right we see the dagger and next to it the number seven,<br />whose primitive meaning we decided would be diced (frame<br />7). It is hard to cut meat or vegetables with a knife without<br />imagining one of those skillful Japanese chefs. Only let us say<br />that he has had too much sake to drink at a party, grabs a dag-<br />ger lying on the mantelpiece and starts dicing up everything in<br />sight, starting with the hors d'oeuvres and going on to cut up<br />the furniture and carpets.... [4]			切		to cut, slice, chop
召	to summon		The primitive meaning remains the same. Just be sure to associate it with a very concrete image, such as a prosecutor at your door with a document that summons you to appear in court. /<div>&nbsp; <b>Pentagram</b></div>	zhào	0082	5	A sword or dagger poised over a mouth is how the character<br />used to summon a person is written. Note the immediate―how<br />shall we put it politely?―Freudian implications of the charac-<br />ter. (Observe, too, if you will, that it is not at all clear whether<br />the long slender object is summoning the small round one or<br />vice versa.) [5]		visualization: pentagram	召		to call together, summon, convene
昭	evident			zhāo	0083	9	"Nothing quite works to make something evident like ""evidence""<br />that backs it up. Here we see a lawyer who summons the sun<br />down from the noonday sky to stand as a witness and make the<br />facts as evident as can be. [9]"			昭		manifest, clear, obvious, evident
則	Rule			zé	0084	9	The character depicts a clam alongside a great and flashing<br />saber. Think of digging for clams in an area where there are<br />gaming rules governing how large a find has to be before you<br />can keep it. So you take your trusty saber, which you have care-<br />fully notched like a yardstick, crack open a clam and then mea-<br />sure the poor little beastie to see if it is as long as the rules say it<br />has to be. [9]			则		rule, law, regulation; general principle
副	vice—			fù	0085	11	The key word vice- has the sense of someone second-in-com-<br />mand. The great and flashing saber to the right (its usual loca-<br />tion, so you need not worry about where to put it from now<br />on) and the wealth on the left combine to create an image of<br />dividing one's property to give a share to one's vice-wealth-<br />holder. [11]			副		secondary, auxiliary; deputy, assistant, vice-
丁	fourth		When used as a primitive, the character changes its meaning to <i>nail</i> or <i>spike</i>.	dīng	0086	2	This character is fourth in a system of enumeration from first to<br />tenth based on an ancient lunar calendar and referred to as &quot;the<br />celestial stems.&quot; What it shows us is someone waiting fourth in<br />line, using a giant metal spike as a makeshift chair. [2]			丁		4th Heavenly Stem; [nail]; 4th (in order); man, cube
叮	to sting			dīng	0087	5	You know how a bee stings, right? It drives the little barbed<br />spike in its bottom into your skin and then pulls away. Of course,<br />as we noted way back in frame 11, the primitive element for<br />mouth can refer to any kind of orifice, but imagine the damage<br />a bee could inflict if it could sting with its mouth at the same<br />time―a kind of bi-polar attack. [5]	(mosquito bite)		叮		sting (mosquito bite); to stick to a point; ask repeatedly
可	can			kě	0088	5	"To begin with, you will notice that this character is composed of<br>the very same elements as that of the former frame. Only their<br>arrangement is different.<br>Remember the story about the ""Little Engine that Could""<br>when you hear this key word, and the rest is simple. See the<br>determined little locomotive huffing and puffing up the moun-<br>tain―""I think I can, I think I can...""―spitting railroad spikes<br>out of its mouth as it chews up the line to the top. [5]"			可		can; may; able to
哥	Older Brother			gē	0089	10	The older brother is depicted here as a duplication of the char-<br>acter for can. It shouldn't take too much work to imagine him,<br>for whatever reason, as a can-can brother. [10]			哥		elder brother
頂	crest			dǐng	0090	11	The key word can refer to the summit or crest of a mountain,<br />but the crest of the head works better here. The immediate<br />image this conjures up is the head of a rooster with its comb<br />or a cockatoo with its crest feathers. And from there it is but a<br />short step to think of the punk hairstyles that imitate this look<br />by shaping the hair into a row of brightly colored spikes. So a<br />spike-head becomes a crest. [11]	(of hill)	(гребень)	顶		top, summit, peak; to carry on the head
乙	second		Since this is also a pictograph of a <i>hook</i> or <i>fishhook</i>, let us take these as primitive meanings. Its shape will rarely be quite the same as that of the character. When it appears at the bottom of another primitive, it is straightened out, almost as if the weight of the upper element had bent it out of shape:𠃊&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />When it appears to the right of another element, the short horizontal line that gets the shape started is omitted, and the whole character is stretched out and narrowed ― all for reasons of space and aesthetics: 乚&nbsp;&nbsp;	yǐ	0091	1	This character belongs to the same series of &quot;celestial stems&quot; as<br />that in frame 86 of the last lesson. The second person in line is<br />seated in what looks like a rocking chair (much better situated<br />than the fourth seat). [1]			 乙		2nd Heavenly Stem; [fishguts]; 2nd (in order), second class, ethanol
子	child		As a primitive, this character retains the meaning of <i>child</i>, though you might imagine a little older <i>child</i>, able to run around and get into more mischief.	zǐ	0092	3	This character is a pictograph of a child wrapped up in one of<br />those handy cocoons that Indian squaws fix to their backs to<br />carry around young children who cannot get around by them-<br />selves. (Incidentally, this is why English has taken over the<br />word &quot;papoose&quot; from the Algonquin language to refer to the<br />device itself.) The first stroke is like a wee head popping out for<br />air; the second shows the body and legs all wrapped up; and the<br />final stroke shows the arms sticking out to cling to the mother's<br />neck. [3]			子		1st Earthly Branch; RAT; [11:00pm - 1:00am]; child; offspring, seed
孔	cavity			kǒng	0093	4	A cavity is really just a small hole, but the first thing we think<br />of when we hear the word is that little pothole that shows up in<br />a diseased tooth. The Chinese may not use the character in this<br />sense, but what's to stop us?.<br />Probably the one thing most children fear more than anything<br />else is the dentist's chair. Can you remember the first time as a<br />child you saw your dentist hold an x-ray up to the light and pro-<br />nounce the ominous word &quot;cavity&quot;? Even though you were not<br />likely to know that the word meant that you have an extra hole<br />in your head until you were much older, it did not take long<br />before the sound got associated with the drill and that row of<br />shiny hooks the dentist uses to torture people who are too small<br />to fight back. [4]			孔		opening, hole, vent, aperture
吼	to roar			hǒu	0094	7	A mouth and a cavity combine to create the character for roar.<br>It shouldn't tax your memory banks too much to think back<br>to how you howled and roared the first time you had a cavity<br>drilled by a doctor poking around inside your mouth with his<br>weapons of dental destruction. [7]			吼		roar (of a lion), to howl
了	—ed			le	0095	2	"This character is most frequently used as a grammatical par-<br>ticle. Since it can indicate completion of an action, it is here<br>assigned the key word -ed. Learn this character by returning<br>to frame 92 and the image given there. The only difference is<br>that the ""arms"" have been left off (actually, only tuck-ed inside).<br>Thus a child with its arms wrapp-ed up into the backsack is the<br>picture of a job successfully complet-ed.<br>Incidentally, you should be aware that this grammatical par-<br>ticle has generated a great deal of debate among specialists. [2]"			了		[completed action marker]
女	Woman		The primitive meaning is the same: <i>woman</i>. It will help if you have a particular person in mind.	nǚ	0096	3	You have probably seen somewhere the form of a squatting<br>woman drawn behind this character, with two legs at the bot-<br>tom, two arms (the horizontal line) and the head poking out<br>the top. A little farfetched, until you draw the character<br>and feel the grace and flow of the three simple strokes.<br>Remembering the character is easy; being able to write it<br>beautifully is another thing. [3]			女		female; woman
好	good			hǎo	0097	6	The sense of good carried by this character is very broad in<br>range. And what better image for this than a woman holding<br>her child. [6]			好		good, well, fine
如	to be like		Duckface (<i>Woman</i> does it with her <i>mouth</i> to <b>be like</b> some celebrity)	rú	0098	6	Pardon us if we revert to the venerable old Dr. Freud again,<br />but his eye for symbolism is often helpful to appreciate things<br />that more earthy imaginations once accepted more freely but<br />that we have learned to cover over with a veneer of etiquette.<br />For instance, from ancient times things like the mouth of a<br />cave have served as natural ritual substitutes for the opening<br />through which a woman gives birth. This is just one example of<br />the way in which one thing can be like another in a metaphori-<br />cal sense and can therefore help unlock the hidden meanings of<br />ritual and symbolism. [6]			如		to be like, be as good as; to comply with; if, as
母	Mother		As a primitive, this character will take on the added meaning of <i>breasts</i> in accord with the explanation given above. Take careful note of the fact that the form is altered slightly when this character serves as a primitive, the two dots joining together to form a longer stroke: 毌. An example follows in the next frame.	mǔ	0099	5	Look closely at this character and you will find the outline of<br />the character for woman in it, the second stroke of which has<br />been expanded to make space for the two breasts that help a<br />mother be a mother. [5]			 母		mother
貫	to pierce			guàn	0100	11	If one is asked to think of associations for the word pierce,<br />among the first to come to mind is that of piercing one's ears<br />to hold earrings, a quite primitive form of self-mutilation that<br />has survived into the twenty-first century. The character here<br />is read, top to bottom: mother . . . oyster. All you need to do is<br />imagine piercing an ear so that it can hold a mother-of-pearl<br />you have just wrested from an oyster. [11]			贯		to pierce, pass through; to string together
兄	Elder Brother		As a primitive this character will take the meaning of <i>teenager</i>, in accord with the familiar image of the big <i>mouth</i> and the gangling, clumsy <i>legs</i>.	xiōng	0101	5	The difference between &quot;older brother&quot; (frame 89) and elder<br />brother is ever so slight in English, the latter sounding just a bit<br />less colloquial. The same is the case in Chinese.<br />By now characters like this one should &quot;look like&quot; something<br />to you even though it is more of an &quot;ideogram&quot; than a &quot;picto-<br />graph.&quot; The large mouth on top and the human legs below almost<br />jump off the page as a caricature of elder brother, the one with<br />the big mouth (or if you prefer a kinder image, the one who &quot;has<br />the say&quot; among all the children). [5]			兄		elder brother
克	to overcome			kè	0102	7	"In this frame we get a chance to use the character we just learned<br>in its primitive meaning of teenager. The needle on top indicates<br>one of the major problems confronting the teenager growing<br>up in today's world: drugs. Many of them will fall under the<br>shadow of the needle at some time during those tender years.<br>Only when a whole generation rises up and declares, ""We Shall<br>Overcome,"" will the needle cease to hang over their heads as it<br>does in this character. [7]"			克		to subdue; to restrain, overcome
小	small		The primitive meaning remains the same, <i>small</i>. Written above a horizontal line, its form is slightly altered, the last two strokes turning inwards like this: ⺌.	xiǎo	0103	3				小		small, tiny; insignificant
少	few		<i>Shàolín monk</i>	shǎo	0104	4				少		few, less; inadequate
吵	noisy			chǎo	0105	7	<div><i>Mouth</i>...<i>Shàolín monk(few)</i>.<br />You might think that noisy should be associated with many peo-</div>ple talking at once, but the idea in this character is much more<br />philosophical than that: What happens when things get noisy<br />is that peopled vocabulary shrinks to a more neolithic level the<br />higher the volume is turned up. And so it is that noisy becomes<br />associated with the very few things a mouth can say when it<br />is talking loudly. Try to picture people quoting Shakespeare to<br />each other in a shouting match, and you will see how right this<br />character is. [7]			吵		noisy; to make a racket, disturb; to squabble
大	large		When used as a primitive, this character needs a different meaning, since the element representing the human person will come up later. Therefore, this shape will become a <i>large dog</i> or, if you prefer, a <i>St. Bernard dog</i>. In frame 225 we will explain why this choice was made.	dà	0106	3	Here we have a simple pictograph of a person taking up the<br />space of an entire character and giving it the sense of large. It<br />should not be too hard to locate the two legs and outstretched<br />arms. [3]			大		big, great, large, vast
尖	tip			jiān	0107	6	The tip this character refers to is the tapered point of something<br />like a pen or a pagoda. The composition of the elements, small<br />and large, is perfectly suited to the image of a small tip at the<br />end of something larger. [6]	, point		尖		point, pinnacle; pointed, sharp; shrewd
夕	Evening			xī [普], xì [國]	0108	3	"Just as the word evening adds a touch of formality or roman-<br />ticism to the ordinary word ""night"" so the character for eve-<br />ning takes the ordinary looking moon in the night sky and has<br />a cloud pass over it—partially hiding it and hence eliminating<br />the final stroke."			夕		evening, sunset; (dusk =&nbsp;&nbsp;xì )
多	many			duō	0109	6	"""Many moons ago,"" begins much of Amerindian folklore—a<br>colorful way of saying ""Once upon a time"" and a great deal of<br>help for remembering this character. Here we have two moons.<br>(three of them would take us back to the beginning of time,<br>which is further than we want to go.) [6]"			多		many, much, a lot of, numerous, multi-
夠	enough			gòu	0110	11	"""<b>Enough</b> is <b>enough</b>."" Who has not been scolded with these<br />words in their youth by a parent or teacher who has run out of<br />patience! Now if you can conjure up the memory of a particular<br />time you yourself blasted those words out at someone who wal<br />trying your patience, imagine that short <i>sentence</i> becoming an<br />uncontrollable obsession, as you walk off into the sunset mut-<br />tering it <i>many</i> times&nbsp;&nbsp;-- over and over and over again. [11]"			够		to reach, be enough; adequate, sufficient
外	Outside			wài	0111	5	On the left, the primitive for evening, and on the right,-<br>for the magic wand. Now, as every magician worth his abraca-<br>dabra knows, bringing your magic wand out into the evening<br>air makes your magic much more powerful than if you were to<br>stay indoors. Hence, evening and magic wand takes you natu-<br>rally outside. [5]			外		outside, external; foreign; unofficial
名	a Name			míng	0112	6	"Perhaps you have heard of the custom, still preserved in certain<br />African tribes, of a father creeping into the tent or hut of his<br />newborn child on the night of the child's birth, to whisper into<br />its ear the name he has chosen for it, before making his choice<br />public. It is an impressive ""naming"" custom and fits in tidily<br />with the way this character is constructed: evening • • • mouth. At<br />evening time, a mouth pronounces the name that will accom-<br />pany one throughout life. [6]"			名		name; title, rank
厚	thick			hòu	0113	9	When we refer to someone as thick-skinned or thickheaded,<br>we are often quick to add -- even if only under our breath --<br>something about their upbringing. Perhaps it is because deep<br>down we cherish the belief that by nature people are basically<br>tender and sensitive.<br>Be that as it may, the Chinese character for thick depicts a<br>child abandoned out on the wild cliffs, exposed to the heat of the<br>sun and thus doomed to develop a head and skin as thick as the<br>parent who left it there. [9]			厚		thick (for flat things); substantial, generous
石	stone		The <i>stone</i> is a quite common primitive element, which is not restricted to great boulders but is used for <i>pebbles</i> or <i>rocks</i> of any size or shape.	shí	0114	5	With a mouth under cliff, what else could we have here but the entrance to a secret cavern, before which a great stone has been rolled so that none may enter? Perhaps it is the hiding place where Ali Baba and his band of thieves have stored their treasures, in which case that magic word known to every school child who ever delighted in the tales of the Arabian Nights should be enough to push the stone aside. But take care—the cliff is steep, and one slip will send you tumbling down into the ravine below.<br />This is the first of two occasions (for the other, see frame 902) on which the second stroke in cliff will reach over slightly to the right beneath the horizontal stroke. If you think of the edge jutting outwards (in keeping with the story above), the problem should be taken care of. [5]			石		rock; stone; mineral
砂	Gravel			shā	0115	9	"<div><i>Stone</i>...<i>Shàolín monk(few)</i>.<br />In this character a few stones take on the meaning of gravel. Imagine ordering a wheelbarrow of stones from your local quarry and having them dump an entire truckload on your garden path. Imagine how annoyed you would be: ""I said a few stones, a little gravel for my walkway—not a blooming moun­tainside!""</div>"			砂		pebbles, gravel, sand; gritty
妙	wonderful			miào	0116	7	<div><i>Woman</i>...<i>Shàolín monk(few)</i>.<br />primitive for woman is on the left (there and at the bottom of another primitive is where you will always find her), and to the right the element for few. When we refer to a woman as wonderful, we mean to praise her as the sort of person we meet but few of and far between. [7]</div>	(<u>not</u>&nbsp;<i>attractive</i>)		妙		wonderful, excellent; clever
肖	to resemble		When this character is used as a primitive, its meaning changes to <i>sparks</i> or <i>candle</i>.	xiào	0117	7	"The word resemble should suggest, among other things, a son who resembles his father. A ""chip off the old block"" is the way we often put it, but the character is more simple. It speaks of a small bit of flesh. [7]"			肖		to resemble, be like; resembling
削	to peel			xiāo&nbsp;&nbsp;(also: xuē [普], xuè [國])	0118	9	For want of a kitchen knife, you decide to peel an apple with a saber. You strike a warrior's pose, toss the apple into the air, and with a guttural shout, brandish your trusty saber in the air with lightning speed. Can you see the sparks flying and the peelings falling to the ground? [9]			削		to peel, pare, whittle; to scrape
光	Ray			guāng	0119	6	The fourth stroke that separates them is added for reasons of aesthetics. (If that doesn't make sense, try writing the character without it and see how ugly the results look, even to your begin­ner's eye.)<br />Now if you have wondered what those little particles of &quot;dust&quot; are that dance around in the light rays that come through the window and fall on your desk, try imagining them as small and disembodied human legs, and you should have no trouble with this character. [6]			光		light; ray; brightness, lustre; glory
太	overly			tài	0120	4	"All right, you are wondering, overly ""what""? Given the legend­ary temperament of the St Bernard dog, we may suppose that it is being overly affectionate. Hence the large drop of slobber— yuck. [4]"			太		too; extremly; highest; senior
省	to economize			shěng	0121	9	<div><i>Shàolín monk(few)</i>...<i>shells</i>.</div>When we decide it's time to economize, we take it for granted that we will need to trim back our appetites a bit. If one's eyes can be too big for one's stomach, they can also be too big for ones pocketbook. Or, as this character suggests, too many. Imagine yourself with eyes all over your head, so that in order to economize you will have to pluck most of them out until only a few remain. [9]			省		to save, economize, use sparingly; province
奇	strange			qí	0122	8	"The elements we are given to work with here are St. Bernard dog&nbsp;&nbsp;and can. Lots of phrases pop to mind to attach these words to the keyword but they end up being too abstract because of the word can.<br>It is helpful in such cases (and there will be a number of them as we go along) to stick closely to the more basic elements, in this case, mouth and nails. Now all we need do is create a fictitious ""Strange but true"" Column in the Sunday funnies, featuring a St.Bernard's dog whose mouth has been sealed shut with a <br>row of nails because he was hitting the brandy keg around his neck too hard. [8]"			奇		strange, odd, weird; unexpected
川	Stream		As a primitive, this character will denote a <i>stream</i> or a <i>flood</i>. Note, however, that there are certain small changes in the writing of the element, depending on where it appears rela­tive to other elements:<br />on the left, it is written)&nbsp;&nbsp;on the top, it is written on the bottom, it is written	chuān	0123	3	in this frame. The reason there are no wavy lines is simply that the Chinese characters no longer use them. [3]			川		stream, river; Sichuan (abbrev.)
州	a state			zhōu	0124	6	Here we see drops of land (little islets) rising up out of a stream^ creating a kind of sandbar or breakwater. Ever wonder how the state line is drawn between states separated by a river? If there were little drops of land as in the character, there'd be nothing to it. [6]	(in the US)		州		state, province
順	to obey			shùn	0125	12	"In the language of the primitives, this character would read stream • • • head. This turns out to be convenient for remember­ing its meaning of obey. Either one obeys the person who is head of an organization or else obeys by following the stream of opinion (""current"" practice, we call it). Both these senses come together in this character. [12]"			顺		to obey, submit to, follow
水	Water		As a primitive, this character can keep its form, or it can be written with three drops to the left of another primitive, like this:氵 This latter, as we will see, is far more common. It can also be written stiffly, in five strokes, as 氺 in which case we will take it to mean a <i>snowflake</i>. An example will fol­low shortly. Finally, as we will see later in frame 380, in the printed form, the <i>snowflake</i> element can be straightened out to give&nbsp;&nbsp;•	shuǐ	0126	4	This character, which looks a bit like a snowflake, is actually a pictograph of water―not any particular body of water or movement of water, but simply the generic name for water. Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think of a walking stick being dropped vertically into the water, sending droplets out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn is how to write it in proper order. [4]			水		water; liquid
永	Eternity			yǒng	0127	5	This character also uses the full form of water, though its meaning seems to have nothing at all to do with it. Remember what William Blake said about seeing &quot;infinity in a grain of sand and eternity in an hour&quot;? Well, reading this character from top to bottom, we see &quot;eternity in a drop of water?<br />Note how the introduction of the drop requires that the first stroke of water begin with a short horizontal &quot;starter line.&quot; Try leaving it out and you will see how reasonable this is. [5]			永		forever, always; perpetual(ly)
求	to request			qiú	0128	7	"Let the key word suggest a formal invitation that begins, ""Mr.<br />and Mrs. Snow <b>request</b> the honor of your presence at the wed-<br />ding of their beloved daughter <i>Snowflake</i> to Drip<i>drop</i> the son<br />of Mr. and Mrs. Leak. • ••"" The only stroke remaining to account<br />for is the <i>one</i> that runs between and ""unites"" the happy couple<br />together until death (or sunlight) do them part. [7]"			求		to request, beseech, demand
泉	a Spring&nbsp;&nbsp;[ie: Well]		We will keep this image of a <i>spring</i> when using this character as a primitive, but not without first drawing attention to a slight change that distinguishes the primitive from the character. The final four strokes (the element for <i>water</i>) are abbreviated to the three small <i>drops</i> that we learned earlier as the character for <i>small</i>, giving us:	quán	0129	9	Call to mind the image of a fresh, bubbling spring of watery<br />and you will probably notice how the top of the spring you are<br />thinking of, the part where the &quot;bubbling&quot; goes on, is all white.<br />Happily, the white is just where it should be, at the top, and the<br />water is at the bottom. [9]			泉		fountain, spring
原	flatlands			yuán	0130	10	&quot;The flatlands are alive, with the sound of muuusic... •&quot; Well,<br />tìiey are in this case anyway, though the setting is a rather grisly<br />one. Watch Schwester Maria as she skips along merrily, dodging<br />in and out of the springs that pop up like landmines until she<br />comes to the edge of a cliff and loses her balance. Listen to her<br />words echoing as she falls and this character should be yours<br />forever. [10]			原		prairie, plain, grassland; primary, original
願	a Wish			yuàn	0131	19	Flatlands and a head are all we are given to work with in the character for wish. Since the key word already suggests some­thing like a formal request made of some higher power, let us imagine a gigantic Wizard-of-Oz head located in the middle of the üowery flatlands we saw in the last frame. Then just picture people kneeling before it, each with a wish they hope to have fulfilled. (The scarecrow wanted brains, the lion courage, and the tin man a heart. What about you?) [19]			愿		to desire, want; hope; wish
沖	to wash away			chōng	0132	7	"Imagine a few innocent looking drops of water creeping up on you to wash you away out into the middle of the ocean. Impossible, you say? Not if drops of water have drifted in from the Bermuda Triangle where they have had a lot of practice at washing away everything from yachts to ocean liners. In any case, this character gives a completely new meaning to the dan­ger of ""drowning in a teaspoonful of water? [7]"			冲		to rinse, steep, wash away; to clash, collide
泳	to swim			yǒng	0133	8	On the left we see again the primitive for drops of water. To the right, we see the character for eternity. Knowing how much children like to swim, what could be a better image of an eter-nity of bliss than an endless expanse of water to swim in with­out a care in the world? [8]	(<u>not</u> <i>to go swimming</i>)		泳		to swim, dive; swimming
洲	Continent			zhōu	0134	9	If states are separated by smaller bodies of waterf continents are separated by great oceans. The drops of water to the left of state fill this function. [9]			洲		continent; island
沼	Marsh			zhǎo	0135	8	Unlike the flatlands with their cliffs, the marshlands are low and near a source of water that feeds them until they get soggy through and through. Why certain land becomes marsh is probably due to the fact that it feels thirsty, and so tries its best to summon the water over to its side. But, like so many tempta­tions, the last state of the victim is worse than the first. Hence the slushy marsh. [8]			沼		pool, pond; swamp
沙	Sand			shā	0136	7	<div><i>Water</i>...<i>Shàolín monk(few)</i>.</div>Learn this character in connection with that for gravel from frame 115. The difference between sand and gravel is one your feet know very well from walking along the beach. The sand is finer and the gravel cuts into the skin. Hence the element for stone figures prominently in gravel, whereas that for water (which, after all has done the work of grinding away at the stone for centuries) shows up here in sand. [7]			沙		sand; powder; granulated; hoarse
江	Yangtze			jiāng	0137	6	"China's equivalent to the Mighty Mississippi is the Yangtze. In fact, the character in this frame, although genetically meaning river, can be used as an abbreviation for the Yangtze, much the same as the ""River"" of ""Ole Man River"" is for those who live on water and an I-beam. Actually, the heavy metal I-beam is being launched as a raft by some mentally challenged Huck Finn hop"			江		the Yangtze; large river
汁	Juice			zhī	0138	5	st any ordinary juice, but a brew of water and nee-dies. Its distinctively sharp taste cuts your thirst by distracting it with excruciating pain as the juice passes down your throat. [5]			汁		juice
潮	Tide			cháo	0139	15	To get the meaning of the key word tide, just think of the ebb and flow of a dynasty's fortunes―literally. Watch as all the wealth of the empire flows into the emperor's court at high tide, and note how everything there empties out back into the popu­lace when it is at low tide.			潮		tide, flow, current, movement
源	source			yuán	0140	13	With the advice of the last frame in mind, it is easy to see water гпа flatlands in this character for source. Both in its etymology (it has a common parent with the word &quot;surge&quot;) and in popular usage, source suggests the place water comes from. In this char­acter, it is under the flatlands, where we earlier saw it breaking the surface in those bubbly little springs. [13]	(not <i>spring</i>)		源		source, root; cause
活	lively			huó	0141	9	When we speak of a lively personality or a lively party, we immediately think of a lot of chatter. This character depicts the idea of lively by having tongues babble and splash around like flowing water. [9]			活		alive, living, lively; to live
消	to extinguish			xiāo	0142	10	Among the many things water can do is help extinguish fires, and that is just what we have here. First of all, take the water at the left as the drops of water that are used to depict water in general. In the best of all possible worlds, the most efficient way to extinguish a fire would be to see that each drop of water hits one spark of the conflagration. An unthinkable bit of Utopian fire fighting, you say to yourself, but helpful for assigning this key word its primitives. [10]			消		vanish, disappear, melt away
況	Situation			kuàng	0143	8	"What we have here is ""an awkward situation."" The teenager of the family has used up all the water for his bath, and there is nothing left to make tea. What the hey, its all in the fimüly, you say, and rather than throw out the bathwater, you decide to keep the situation secret and make the tea anyway. Little do the guests know, as they sip their tea daintily, that the tea is not the only thing in the hot water. [8]"			况		situation, condition; furthermore
河	river			hé	0144	8	<i>Water..can</i>	(the Yellow River)	<i><br /></i>	河		river; galaxy
湖	Lake			hú	0145	12	Rather than use the character for recklessly from frame 17 as a primitive element, let us take the elements one by one: water ...ancient.. .flesh. You have heard of legends of people being abandoned in the mountains when they had become too ancient to work. Well, here is a legend about people being set adrift in the waters of a stormy lake because their flesh had gotten too ancient to bear the burdens of life. [12]			湖		lake
測	to fathom			cè	0146	12	"Connoting the measurement of the depth of water, the keyword fathom begins with the water primitive. To its right, we see the character for rule (frame 84) which we learned in the sense of ""gaming rules."" Now when we measure the depth of water, we have to follow a different set of rules than those we use to measure the fish we pull out of it. We fathom it; that is, we mea­sure it in units of six feet. Picture yourself fathoming a body of water several hundred feet deep according to official тиЩ which stipulate that you must use a government-approved tape measure and avoid the use of electronic equipment. [12]"			测		to conjecture, ponder; to estimate, predict, measure
土	Soil		When this character is used as a primitive, the sense of <i>soil</i> is extended to that of <i>ground</i> because of its connection with the character for the same (frame 478). From there it also takes the added meanings of <i>dirt</i> and <i>land</i>.	tǔ	0147	3	We don't like it any more than you do, but this character is not the pictograph it is trumped up to be: a mound of soil piled on the ground. All we can recommend is that you memorize it as it is. Anyway, it will be occurring with such frequency that you have almost no chance of forgetting it, even if you try. [3]			土		earth, dirt, soil; land
均	to equal			jūn	0148	7	The idea of making things equal is pictured here at its most basic: land reform. It provides soil in uniform portions to every­one. To help with the association, we may recall the famous line of Napoleon the Pig in George OrwelFs 1984: &quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&quot; Picture one of those suspicious land reforms going on in the barnyard and led by one group of animals (the pigs) who apportion the largest parcels to themselves and ration out among everyone else uniform slivers of land too small to live on. [7]			均		equal, even, fair, uniform; equally
肚	belly			dù	0149	7	Here we see a part of the body that looks like a mound of soil. What else could it be but that large compost pile that over-eat-<br />key word belly already suggests something bell-shaped. [7]			肚		belly, abdomen, stomach
填	to fill in			tián	0150	13	When you fill in a form, it is expected that the information be ше said, most people are less concerned with foil and true disclosure than with protecting their privacy, whereas those who make the forms are often more interested in getting the dirt on them. If you can imagine filling in some of the blanks with shovelfuls of actual dirt to give them what they want, you wm keep the metaphor more concrete. [13]			填		to fill in, complete (a form)
吐	to spit			tǔ	0151	6	We have here a rather small mouth (it is always compressed when set on the left) next to a much larger piece of dirt It is not hard to imagine what you might do if you got a mouth full of dirt As least we know what we would do: spit it out as fast and far as we could! [6]			吐		to spit
哇	Waaah!			wā	0152	9	The shrill cries of a bawling infant can be more piercing than any noise an adult makes, which is why they are so hard to ignore. In this character, we see the sounds of that cry, Waah!, likened to a mouth spitting out bricks to shatter the silence of our sleep. [9]			哇		[sound of child's crying]
寸	Chinese Inch			cùn	0153	3	This character stands for a small measurement used prior to the metric system, a little less than 1V3 English inches in length and one-tenth of a Chinese foot (which we will meet later, in Book 2). The character, appropriately, represents one drop of a ten (with a hook!). [3]			寸		the width of a person's thumb
封	to seal			fēng	0154	9	Think of the key word seal in connection with a letter you have written and are preparing to close. Instead of using the tradi­tional hot wax to seal the document, you glue a brick on the outside一a love letter swab (sealed with a brick). A romantic thought, but the postage will bankrupt you. [9]			封		to seal; envelope
寺	Buddhist Temple			sì	0155	6	"You have heard of people ""attaching"" themsdves to a particular sect? Here is your chance to take that metaphor literally and imagine some fellow walking into a Buddhist temple with a fervent resolve to attach himsdf to the place. Since there is plenty of unused land around the precincts, he simply picks out a suitable patch, brushes the soles of his feet with glue, steps down firmly, and so joins the Buddhist temple as a ""permanent member."" [6]"			寺		Tibetan Buddhist temple
時	Time			shí	0156	10	"""What is time?” asked St. Augustin in his memoirs, “Ask me not, and I know. Ask me, and I cannot tell you."" Here we have a curious answer to that perennial riddle. Time is a sun riling over a Buddhist temple. It sounds almost like a Zen kōan whose repetition might yield some deep secret to the initiated. At any rate, imagining a monk seated in meditation pondering it might help us remember the character. [10]"			时		time, hour, o'clock; when; tense [grammar]
火	Fire		Although the generic meaning of <i>fire</i> can be carried over as a primitive meaning, it is usually best to keep to the mean­ing of <i>flames</i> or <i>fireplace</i>. Another primitive element for fire, based on this one, is written 灬 and will mean <i>cooking fire</i>.	huǒ	0157	4	Just as sitting before a fire enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the flames, this character is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of fire you want to see. It no longer makes a good pictograph, but we invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form一first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there一to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to ciga­rette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes. [4]			火		fire, flame; rage
灰	ashes			huī	0158	6	The character for ashes naturally includes the primitive for fire, or more specifically, a fireplace. Now what do you do with that bucket of ashes you have just cleaned out of the fireplace? You strap it to your belt and walk around with it by your side until the wind scatters them, with distributive justice, over everyone else's property. [6]			灰		ash, dust
煩	vexed			fán	0159	13	"When people are vexed about something, they often refer to themselves as ""really burned"" about it. In this character, the per­son head is on fire) raising the metaphor to new heights. [13]"			烦		troubled, vexed, annoyed, fed up
炎	Inflammation			yán	0160	8	A fire belongs in the fireplace, not over it. When the fire spreads to the rest of the house, we have an inflammation of the house. As with any inflammation—including those that attack our bodies一the danger is always that it might spread if not checked. This is the sense behind the reduplication of the element for fire, one atop the other. [8]			炎		flame; inflammation; -itis
淡	thin			dàn	0161	11	"You may not think there is such a thing as thin water or thin fire, but when you mix fire and water, the one does make the other thin. When you see this key word, think not of ""slender"" but of thin in the sense of pale, diluted, or weak. Paint thinner makes paint thin in this way (though we do not recommend mixing it vnthfire9 unless you want a real inflammation). [11]"	(pale, diluted, weak)		淡		weak, thin, watery; bland, insipid
災	Disaster			zāi	0162	7	Of all of nature's disasters, this character picks out two of the worst floods dLTìdfires. To recall the disposition of the elements, think of nature's solution to nature's own problem: a great flood pouring down over a great forest fire. [7]			灾		disaster, calamity, catastrophe
照	to illuminate			zhào	0163	13	"Although the range of possible meanings that the character for illuminate can have is about as rich as the connotations of the English word, we need to focus on just one of them: to make something obscure evident. If you glaze a pot and put it into the oven to ""ère"" it, you in fact illuminate it. Hence the character for illuminate makes a connection between the character for <i>evident</i> and the primitive element for <i>cooking fire</i>. [13]"			照		light up, illuminate, shine, reflect; photograph
魚	a Fish			yú	0164	11	Breaking down this character give us three elements, which we list in the order of their writing: hound up... rice field... cooking fire. Not much to work with at first sight. But we can join them together by thinking of a three-part story: first a fish is caught and bound up on a line with its unfortunate schoolmates; when the fisherman gets home, he cuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the rice field for fertilizer; and the rest he sets in a skillet over a cookingfire for his supper. [11]			鱼		fish
漁	Fishing			yú	0165	14	To the story we have just made about fish, this character for the profession of fishing adds yet another element before the others: namely the water, where the fish was happily at home before being caught, disemboweled, and eaten. Be sure to get a clear image of the water when you put it all together to create a picture of fìshing. [14]	(activity)		渔		to fish; fishing; to seize, filch
堯	Yao		Used as a primitive, this character will be associated with the image of that unforgettable character in the Charlie Brown cartoon strips, <i>Pigpen</i>. Or, if you prefer, some par­ticularly memorable slob from your high-school days. The association should be obvious: <i>dirt</i>, <i>dirt</i> everywhere and a <i>pair of human legs</i>.	Yáo	0166	12	This character, used as a family name, is best associated with the legendary sage king Yao, who lived around 2300 все and became a model for rulers in ancient China. One fact about this king, which can help us remember the writing of the charac­ter, is that he is said to have invented the board game of Go as a way to sharpen the brain of his dim-witted son. Here we see the son as simply a pair of human legs (no brain attached), playing Go on the floor with little clumps of dirt (instead of the customary stones). [12]			尧		Emperor Yao (2358 - 2258 BCE), an ancient sage
燒	Fever			shāo	0167	16	"Picture little Pigpen as ""running a fever."" Can you see the fire chasing after him as he runs away, kicking up even more dust thaji he usually does? [16]"			烧		to burn; to bake, cook, roast; fever
曉	Dawn			xiǎo	0168	16	When you think of the dawn, imagine the sun rising up over the horizon, drenching the landscape in a golden color. Imagine little Pigpen sitting in the middle of a field, getting scrubbed		{From 日 (rì) 'sun' and 尧(堯) yáo phonetic.<br />2767 堯(S尧) [Yáo] (surname); a legendary emperor (2200 B.C.)<br />堯[尧] ¹Yáo n. 〈hist.〉 legendary founding emperor, a model of wisdom and virtue}<br />	晓		dawn, daybreak; to know, tell
里	a Li&nbsp;&nbsp;[measurement]		To get a more concrete primitive meaning for this character, we shall refer to it as a <i>computer</i>, a meaning deriving from the character for <i>logic</i>, which we will meet in Lesson 12. To remember the meaning, it might help to think of the alternative meaning of the primitive at the top: <i>brains</i>.	lǐ	0169	7	That's right—a li. Don't bother looking it up in your English dictionary; it's a Chinese unit of distance. One li is about a half kilometer. The character depicts how the measure came to be used. Atop we see the rice field, and below the element for land. Think of those four sections you see in the rice field (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in frame 14) as blocks of land. Thus, a land division based on the size of a rice field would be a li. [7]			里		unit of length (0.5 km); in, inside
量	quantity			liàng	0170	12	Think of quantity as having to do with measuring time and dis­tance, and the rest is simple: you have a quantity of time in the new day that begins with daybreak, and a quantity of distance in the rural li. [12]			量		quantity, capacity, amount
埋	to bury			mái	0171	10	"When we bury something (or someone, for that matter), we usually mean putting it under ground. Only here, we are bury­ing our beloved computer that has served us so well these past years. Behind us a choir chants the ""Dies irae, dies ilia"" and there is much wailing and grief among the bystanders as they pass by to shovel a little dirt into what will be its final resting place, r.i.p. [10]"			埋		to bury, hide (away)
黑	black			hēi	0172	12	Three frames ago we noted that it might help to think of the top part of the primitive for computer as brains. In this character you will see why. Note how the third stroke, ordinarily written as a single horizontal line, is here broken up into a pair of ani­mal horns right in the middle of the element. Think of this as a brain impaled (literally) on the horns of a dilemma.<br />That done, there is no problem with this character. Like most things electrical, a computer, too, can overheat, and often this happens because its brain is caught on the horns of a dilemma. Now look closely with your imaginative eye and you can see the horns sprouting out of the cpu and flames pouring out of the computer to char the keyboard, the monitor, and your desk a sooty black color. [12]			黑		black; dark, evil; Heilongjiang Prv. (abbrev.)
點	Spot			diǎn	0173	17	When Madam Cheng tells fortunes, she not only tells you about the bright and beautiful things that await you but also about the dark, black misfortunes that menace your future like spots on a white background. Look into the crystal ball and you can see these black spots peppered here and there. And if you zoom in, you will see that each spot is a particular place that bodes ill for you. These are, literally, the black spots in your future. [16]			点		dot, speck, spot; point; o'clock
墨	Black Ink			mò	0174	15	Besides meaning black ink, this character also appears in the word for an inked string that is pulled taut and snapped to mark a surface, much the same as a carpenter doing repair work in your home might use a chalked string. Here it is used to mark the dirt on a baseball diamond with a long, hpavy piece of string soaked in black ink. [15]			墨		ink; dark; Mexico (abbrev.)
冒	to risk			mào	0175	9	"In order not to risk being identified, burglars often wear a mask or something else draped over their face. If you look closely at the character and ""read off"" the primitive elements, you will end up with a hood with two slits for the eyes. It would almost be worth trying one on if becoming a burglar didn't risk a lot more than just being recognized.<br />Even if you followed the explanation above, it bears repeating that the top four strokes are not the same as the primitive for sun or day or tongue wagging in the mouth. The difference is subtle but not to be ignored. [9]"			冒		to risk, dare, attempt; to give off, emit
同	same		When this character is used as a primitive, it will mean <i>monks</i> dressed in a common habit.	tóng	0176	6	he primitives in this character show us one and mouth under a hood. Let us take the key word to connote the sense in which monks living in community share the same life, routine, food, and ideals. We might say they all have the same habits, includ­ing the &quot;habit&quot; they wear on their backs. Here we see the monk's cowl, drawn down over the eyes so that all you can see when you look at him is a mouth. But since monks also speak their prayers in common, it is but a short step to think of one mouth under a hood as the character for everything that is the same about monastic life. [6]			同		same, similar, alike; in common, together with
洞	cave			dòng	0177	9	Early hermit-monks often lived in caves where they prayed and fasted for years on end. The one thing they could not do with­out was water. To fix this image, imagine a monk who has filled up his cave with water neck high, which makes it difficult to sleep but at least protects him from dehydration. [9]	(full character)		洞		cave, hole
向	orientation			xiàng	0178	6	"This character begins with a mysterious drop off in the distance. Then we find a sort of transparent helmet with no eyes or nose, but only a prominent mouth under it—obviously an extrater­restrial. And what is it jabbering on about with its mouth open like that? It has strayed far from its spaceship (the drop off in the distance) whose fuel tanks are bone dry. Seeing that the poor creature is completely ""disoriented,"" you offer a first orien­tation to life on earth by handing him a few bucks and pointing the way to the nearest gas station. [6]"			向		direction, to face; to, toward
尚	to esteem			shàng	0179	8	Above we see the primitive for small attached to one of those glass covers you might use to display a family heirloom. Its being small is important, because what is in fact on display is the shrunken, stuffed, and mounted mouth of an ancestor we particularly esteem. We may be used to esteeming the words our forebears leave behind, but here we also esteem the very mouth that spoke them. We leave it to you to imagine a suitable place in your room for displaying such an unusual conversation piece.[8]		Microscope...glass cover...mouth	尚		to esteem, value, put stock in; yet, still
字	character			zì	0180	6	"Here is the character for character itself. Not just Chinese char­acters but any written character from hieroglyphs to Sanskrit to our own Roman alphabet. It shows us simply a child in a house. But let us take advantage of the double meaning of the key word to note that just as a child born to a Chinese house is given characters for its name, so it is also stamped with the ""character"" of those who raise it from infancy on. [6]<br />"			字		letter; character; pronunciation
守	to guard			shǒu	0181	6	If you want to guard, the best way is to post a watchman, like the royal soldiers in front of Buckingham Palace or the Pope's Swiss Guard. The whole idea of hiring people to guard is that they should stick like glue to your house to protect it from unwanted prowlers. So go ahead and find a watchman who is really stuck on his job and glue him to your house to guard it. [6]			守		to guard, observe, watch; to defend
完	to finish			wán	0182	7	"To start a house we lay the foundations; to finish it, a roof. This character shows the ""finished"" product, from the beginnings in the foundation at the bottom, to the roof with its chimney at the top. Come to think of it, the same holds true of anything we start and finish. [7]"			完		to finish, be over; run out; done, complete
實	reality			shí	0183	14	"This apparently complex character is really simplicity itself. It has only two elements: house and pierce. The problem is the key word, which, despite its claims to reality, is about as abstract as they come. But if you think of a house that is really old-fash­ioned and out of touch with reality, then perhaps all it needs is a professional to pierce the chimney, or put a couple of studs on the front door. Who knows, maybe there's a career out there somewhere for a uhouse piercer"" who goes around the suburbs blaring out over a microphone,""Hey, houses, get real!"" [14]"		?reality is what pierces through the roof of your mental house?	实		solid; real, true; reality
宣	to proclaim			xuān	0184	9	"Think of the key word in its religious sense of a missionary preaching: ""proclaiming the good news to all nations"" and ""shouting it from the housetops' all day, day in and day out. The element for daybreak that follows below has an additional stroke at the top. Remembering what we said about the sun creeping up over the horizon (the floor) at daybreak (frame 29), the extra stroke can represent the other horizon towards which the sun journeys, giving us ""sunrise, sunset? That should be enough to help you remember this simple character, used in fact both for traditional missionary work as well as for one of its contemporary replacements: propaganda. [9]"		<div><i>House..from dusk to dawn</i></div>亘 ¹gèn {E} b.f. continuous (in space or time)&nbsp;	宣		to declare, announce, proclaim
宵	Nighttime			xiāo	0185	10	Unlike the &quot;evening&quot; (frame 108), nighttime suggests time spent at night, as in pulling an all-nighter to prepare for an exam when everyone else is fast asleep in bed. The character expresses this by picturing a house with a candle in it. The rea­son is obvious: whoever is living there is passing the nighttime &quot;burning the candle at both ends.&quot; [10]	(not <i>night</i>)		宵		night, nighttime; dark
安	peaceful		<i>A woman with a peace-sign tattoo on her bare thigh</i>.	ān	0186	6	To be told that the place of the woman is in the house may not sit well with modern thought, but like all cultural habits the Chinese characters bear the birthmarks of their age. So indulge yourself in a Norman Rockwell image of a peaceful moment: a weary woman of the house slouched asleep in the living room chair, her hair in curlers and a duster lying in her lap. [6]			安		peace, calm, quiet; peaceful, tranquil; to pacify
宴	Banquet			yàn	0187	10	"To carry on from the last frame, we note the entire day of work that comes between a woman and her house in preparing for a dinner banquet, pictorially ""interrupting"" her peaceful relax­ation. [10]"			宴		feast, banquet, party; to host a dinner
寄	to mail			jì	0188	11	Now there is nothing particularly strange about your normal mailbox, but the one depicted here is a strange house that you actually have to enter to drop off your letters. Think of the haunted House of Usher that Edgar Allen Poe immortalized, or the enchanted Gingerbread House that Hansel and Gretel are heading towards with an armful of letters to mail. [11]	(not 郵)		寄		to mail, sen, transmit; to rely or depend on
富	wealthy			fù	0189	12	Here we have the original character on which the primitive ele­ment for wealth is based. In keeping with the story introduced back then, note how many wealthy people get that way through simple inheritance, being born into the wealth of their parents' house. [12]	(full character, <u>not</u> <i>wealth</i>)		富		rich, wealthy, abundant; to enrich
貯	to store up			zhù	0190	12	This character shows a family that literally stores up its clams by hanging them on a large, six-foot nail driven into a space under the roof of their house. [12]			贮		to store, save up, stockpile, hoard
木	Tree		As a primitive, this character can mean <i>tree</i> or <i>wood</i>. When the last two strokes are detached from the trunk (7k), we shall change its meaning to <i>pole</i> or <i>wooden pole</i>.	mù	0191	4	This is a pictograph of a tree, the main trunk shown in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke and the final two strokes sweeping down in both directions. Although it may look similar at first sight to the character for water (frame 126), the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance. [4]			木		tree; lumber, wood, wooden
林	Woods			lín	0192	8	Learn this frame in connection with the next one. A woods is a small cluster of trees. Hence the simple reduplication of the character for tree gives us a woods. [8]			林		woods, forest; grove
森	Forest			sēn	0193	12	"A forest is a large expanse of trees, or ""trees, trees everywhere,"" to adopt the expression we used in frames 22,23, and 166. [12]"			森		forest; wooded; gloomy
植	to plant			zhí	0194	12	You have no doubt seen how people practicing the Japanese art of bonsai take those helpless little saplings and twist them into crippled dwarves before they have a chance to grow up as they should. The more proper way to plant a young tree and give it a fair shake in life is to set it into the earth in such a way that it can grow up straight. [12]			植		to plant, grow; to establish
杏	Apricot			xìng	0195	7	Since apricots can be eaten just as they fall from the trees, pic­ture this mouth agape at the bottom of a tree (just as the ele­ments have it), waiting for apricots to fall into it. [7]			杏		apricot
呆	dim-witted			dāi	0196	7	The dim-witted thimblehead in this character is seated in the topmost branches of a tree with his mouth agape, waiting for the fruit to fall into it, but the only thing that happens is that nothing happens. [7]			呆		foolish; stupid, simple
枯	withered			kū	0197	9	When a tree is withered and about to die, it is probably due to a kind of arteriosclerosis that keeps its sap from flowing freely. This character shows us an ancient and wrinkled tree with poor circulation, withered up and whiling away its remaining days in a retirement center. [9]			枯		dried up, decayed, withered desiccated, emaciated
村	Village			cūn	0198	7	The character for village shows a circle of trees glued together to measure off the confines of a village. [7]			村		village; rustic, vulgar
相	one another			xiāng	0199	9	The key word one another stirs up associations of people inter­acting. When we read off the elements, tree... eye, we are given an idea of how to keep this interaction amicable by calling to mind the scriptural proverb about first taking the tree trunk out of your own eye before helping your neighbors remove the splinters from theirs. [9]			相		mutual, reciprocal, each other
本	notebook			běn	0200	5	"Recalling that notebooks are made of paper, and paper made of trees, one might think of a notebook as a slice of a tree. Can you see the ""cross-cut"" in the trunk of the tree7. Picture a chainsaw cutting you out a few notebooks to take to school. [5]"			本		book, notebook; root, basis, origin, source
案	legal case			àn	0201	10	"The case that this key word refers to is the legal kind and the image contrasts the attitudes of the parties involved. While you are in a frazzle, the lawyer answers all your phone calls with/Tm working on your <b>case</b>,"" when actually she is swaying, relaxed and <i>peaceful</i>, in a hammock strung up between the <i>trees</i> in her backyard. Imagine that—people actually get paid to take it easy while you do all the worrying. [10]"			案		case, record, file
未	not yet			wèi	0202	5	As the key word suggests, this character has to do with some­thing not quite over and done with. More concretely, it shows us a tree that is not yet fully grown. The extra short stroke in the upper branches shows new branches spreading out, leaving one with the feeling that the tree has a ways to go yet before it reaches maturity. In other words, the character conveys its meaning pictographically, playing on the earlier pictograph of the tree. [5]			未		8th Earthly Branch; SHEEP; [1:00pm - 3:00pm]; not yet, still not
末	Last			mò	0203	5	This character is best learned in connection with that of the previous frame. The first stroke shows a branch that is longer than the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached the last of its growth, so that its top branches stop spreading and start drooping downwards. Be sure to keep this imagery in mind, to avoid confusing this key word with synonyms that will appear later. [5]			末		end, final, last
沫	Foam			mò	0204	8	The foam this character refers to is the last stage of water after it has dashed and splashed against the rocks, spraying in all direc­tions. The foam is thus a wave that has run its full course and reached its last on the rocky seashore. If you picture it in your minds eye, this somewhat rare (but oh-so-easy-to-learn) char­acter is yours for good. [8]			沫		foam, froth, suds, lather
味	Flavor			wèi	0205	8	When a tree has not yet finished growing, it produces fruit with a full flavor. When the official taster (the professional mouth to the left) determines that full flavor has been reached, the tree is pruned back so that it remains permanently not yet grown. A neat little agricultural trick and an easy way to see the sense of flavor hidden in this character. [8]			味		flavor, taste, smell, scent
妹	younger sister			mèi	0206	8	The younger sister in the family is the woman in the family who, like the newest branch in a tree, is not yet old enough or mature enough to do everything the older sister can do (see frame 1298). [8]			妹		younger sister
查	to investigate			chá	0207	9	To investigate is to get to the bottom of something or track something down, which often has you working all through the night, right to daybreak In the case of this character, it is Sir Isaac Newton, who is investigating the laws of physics when the appearance of the sun at daybreak prompts the tree to stretch and welcome a new day. At that, an apple drops from its branches square on Sir Isaac s head, inspiring him to discover the law of universal gravitation. [9]			查		to inspect, check, investigate
渣	sediment			zhā	0208	12	"This character has you in your scuba-diving gear <i>investigating</i> at the bottom of a reservoir to see what has made the <i>water</i> go bad. See yourself mucking around the sediment and finding remnants of all sorts of garbage and chemical waste. Hopefully, someone will find the ""dregs"" of society that put it there and bring them to justice. [12]"			渣		sediement, residue, dregs
染	to dye			rǎn	0209	9	Take a handful of ash tree seeds, plant them in your backyard, and sprinkle them with water mixed with your mothers hair dye. If you are patient enough to nurture this little orchard of ash trees to full size, you could carve yourself out the first-ever- in-history brunette or platinum-streaked baseball bat. [9] 		{From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water', 九 (jiǔ) 'nine', and 木 (mù) 'tree'.<br />        &quot;To dye; imbue with, infect -- the commentator says: 九 nine dippings into a 水 decoction of a special kind of 木 tree&quot; --Karlgren.<br />        Probably no historical relation to 氿 guǐ.<br />==== 氿 [guǐ] 氿泉 guǐquán spring coming out of hillside}	染		to dye; to contract (an illness), acquire (a bad habit)
李	Plum			lǐ	0210	7	"Little Jack Horner has left his corner and his Christmas pie to try out his fortunes with a tree in the garden. He sticks in his thumb and out drops a plum, which says, ""What a weird child you are!"" [7]"			李		plum
桌	Table			zhuō	0211	10	You have to think here of a group of magicians seated around a magical table, which is made out of the stump of a tree, and has the image of a large sun carved into its surface. The magicians pass the magic wand around from hand to hand to see if any of them can make the sun shine. At last, one of them succeeds, and the sun begins to glow (burning a hole in the table in the process). [10]			桌		table; MW for table, desk
若	as if			ruò	0212	9	Here we see a flower held in the right hand, calling to mind the famous story of the Buddha who held up a. flower with his right hand to a small gathering of his disciples. Most of them were perplexed, but Kasyapa smiled and the Buddha handed him the flower, as if he had understood something that everyone else had missed. To this day it remains a mystery what it was that the Buddha communicated to Kasyapa, but everyone treats the story as if it is of pivotal importance. [9]			若		to seem, be like; similar; as, if
草	grass			cǎo	0213	10	Perhaps you know the custom of seeding grass randomly or in some particular pattern with the flower called the crocus, which blooms for a few days each year in early spring. As the grass begins to turn green again after winter has passed, these tiny flowers dot up here and there. Now just look out your window at a patch of grass somewhere and think what a nice idea it would be to have your name spelled out in flowers once as a sort of early harbinger of spring. [10]			草		grass, straw; rough draft
苦	Suffering			kǔ	0214	9	The picture of suffering we are given here is that of a flower that has grown ancient. When a flower ages, it pales and dries up, and probably even endures a kind of botanical suffering. If<br />you think that plants are incapable of such feelings, then ask yourself why so many people believe that talking to their flow­ers helps them bloom better. [9]			苦		to suffer from; suffering, hardship; painstakingly; bitter
寬	wide			kuān	0215	15	The key word wide will suggest a wide-angle lens, since that is one of the first expressions likely to pop into mind at the sound of the word. What we are trying to see in a single view is an immense greenhouse filled with one each of all the flow­ers of the world. Picture yourself trying to see the whole thing through the viewer of your wide-angle lens, and then focusing on a single drop of dew on the tiniest petal of the tiniest blos­som. To see everything in all its detail may be asking a little much of a single lens, but nothing short of such a vision could ever satisfy the curiosity that comes with the gift of sight. [15]			宽		wide, broad, vast, spacious; tolerant
葉	Leaf			yè	0216	13	Two elements we have to work with here are flower and family tree. Now all of us know what it is to have some rotten fruit on the family tree, but let us never forget that it is always possible for even the worst of us to turn over a new leaf and burst into flower if given the chance. [13]			叶		leaf, petal; page; historic period
莫	nobody		When this character is used as a primitive element, we will replace the abstract key word with the more concrete <i>graveyard</i>.	mò	0217	11	"A rickety old sign with the warning written on it ""Nobody, but Nobody Leaves Here"" dangles from a shingle over the entrance to a graveyard. But, contrary to what you expect, this is a thoroughly modern graveyard. Gone are the cobwebs and gnarled trees, the tilted headstones and dark, moonless nights that used to scare the wits out of our childhood imaginations. Instead, we see brightly colored flowers placed before the tombstones, the sun shining gloriously overhead, and a cuddly St Bernard dog sitting at the gate, making sure that nobody tries to leave. [11]"		A dead man with a ripped-of leg lies rotting in the open-air graveyard, with only the sun and some flowers for comfort.	莫		nobody; not; don't, isn't
模	to imitate			mó	0218	15	"Ah, but haven't they made a parody of the modern graveyard in trying to imitate its classic ancestors! The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones is unimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like a marble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This character continues with the modern­ization trend by picturing artificial trees in the graveyard. But of course, how convenient! They don t need pruning or fertilizing, their leaves don t fall, and they remain the same color all year long. But far from imitating the real thing, they end up a cheap ""imitation."" [15]"		A dead <b>imitating mime</b> with a ripped of leg (the only good mime) lies in the fake stone-is-too-expensive <b>wooden</b> <b>graveyard</b>.	模		to imitate; model, pattern, template
漠	Desert			mò	0219	14	Let this key word suggest to you a mirage in a desert. The haze rising up from the desert sands creates the illusion of a body of water in the distance. In fact, the mirage only recedes as you crawl your way across the surface of what will soon be your graveyard. To fix the image, imagine yourself reaching the mirage and finding out that it is in fact a graveyard, in which there is a headstone with your name on it. [14]	(<u>not</u> <i>Drought</i>)		漠		desert; cold, detachedl; indifferently
墓	a Grave			mù	0220	14	The mounds of soil with crude wooden crosses set at their head suggests those Boot Hill graves near Tombstone, Arizona, that many of you will remember from cowboy lore. The only odd thing about this character is that the soil comes under the graveyard, rather than to its left, where we might expect it. Just think of how it looks as you walk toward Boot Hill, with the cross and mound of soil in the foreground.<br />By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a character whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape dif­fers somewhat. There is no cause to worry. By using the primi­tive in a variety of other characters, as we have done here, the confusion will be averted as a matter of course. In most cases, as here, the primitive element is simply one part of the fuller original character. [14]	(full character)		墓		grave, tomb
苗	Seedling		When this character is used as a primitive element, we will adjust its meaning to <i>tomato seedling</i>.	miáo	0221	9	"To avoid confusion with the image of rice seedlings to appear later, we shall take these seedlings out of their agricultural set­ting in the rice fields and into the frame of Brave New World surgery, where ""ideas"" or ""values"" are being implanted into brains like seedlings to insure a harmonious society. Then you need only imagine them taking root and breaking out into flower right through the tops of the skulls of people walking around on the streets. [9]"	"(""tomato seedling"")"		苗		seedling; sprout
瞄	to aim			miáo	0222	14	In order to aim at something through the sights of a rifle, you fix your eyes on the thin crosshairs. In this case, however, the usual crosshairs have been replaced with the completely useless serrated leaves of a tomato seedling. And not only that, they are poking out of where the lens should be and keep tickling your eyeball, keeping you from aiming properly. Obviously the sabo­tage of peacemakers working in a rifle factory. [14]			瞄		to aim, fix one’s eyes on
兆	Portent			zhào	0223	6	Here we have a pictograph of the back of a turtle, the two slop­ing vertical strokes representing the central ridge and the four short strokes the pattern. Think of reading turtle shells as a way to foretell the future, and in particular, to suggest a portent of coming evils. [6]			兆		omen, sign; to foretell; million, mega
桃	peach			táo	0224	10	To associate the peach with the primitive for a portent, recall the famous Japanese legend of Momotaro, the Peach Boy. It begins once upon a time with a fisherman and his wife who wanted badly to have a child, but none was born to them. Then one day the old man caught a giant peach, out of which jumped a healthy young lad whom they named Peach Boy. Though the boy was destined to perform heroic deeds, his birth foreshad­owed great misfortune (how else could he become a hero?). Thus the peach tree is seen as a portent of coming evil. [10]			桃		peach
犬	Pooch			quǎn	0225	4	We have already learned that the character for large takes on the meaning of the St. Bernard dog when used as a primitive. In this frame we finally see why. The drop added as a fourth and final stroke means that we have to do with a much smaller dog, a pooch, which compared to the St. Bernard dog is no more than a drop in the kennel. [4]			犬		dog
尤	remarkable		"As a primitive, this character will keep its meaning of the <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">Frankenpooch</span>."	yóu	0226	4	We learn this next character here simply because it is the easiest place to learn it. Later it will figure as an element of other, more complex characters.<br>The only thing that distinguishes this character from the pooch is its remarkable human leg. As the story goes, the poor creature lost its leg in a car accident and hobbled around pitifully, until one day a mad scientist caught sight of it, dragged it into his castle, and fastened on it the severed leg of a local chorus girl (whose leg had mysteriously flown off her chassis in the middle of a performance, striking a French tourist on the head). So there you have it, the altogether remarkable Frankenpooch. [4]			尤		outstanding; especially, particularly
默	silence			mò	0227	16	"""But my words, like silent raindrops fell...."" The famous ode to ""silence"" from which these words were taken begins with an enigmatic phrase that this character will clear up once and for all: ""Hello, Darkness, my old friend...."" It has long been assumed that Darkness referred to nighttime, but actually it was the name of a silent black chihuahua that hung around the set without ever once barking, eventually inspiring the song. [16]"			默		silent, still, quiet; to write from memory
然	sort of thing			rán	0228	12	"The character in this frame is used as a suffix for certain adverbs and adjectives, and for too many other purposes to capture in a single key word. Rather arbitrarily, we have settled on ""sort of thing."" Reverting to the time when dog was more widely eaten than it is today (see frame 230), we see the flesh of a chihuahua roasting over a cooking fire—a ""hot-diggity, dog-diggity"" sort of thing. [12]"			然		thus, so, certainly, like this, in this manner; -ly
哭	to cry			kū	0229	10	Here we have a chatterbox of a chihuahua. Listen to it gabbing away in its high, shrill voice and you have a pretty good idea of what you sound like when you cry. [10]			哭		to cry, weep; to wail
器	Utensil			qì	0230	16	The picture in this character is not a pleasant one. It shows a tiny little chihuahua lying on a platter all stuffed and stewed and garnished with vegetables, its paws in the air and a cherry in its mouth. At each corner of the table sits an empty but eager mouth, waiting for the utensils to arrive so the feast can begin. [16]			器		device, tool, utensil, instrument
臭	stinking			chòu	0231	10	This character is a bit friendlier to the animal world than the last one. Our friend the chihuahua is alive and well, its nose in the air sniffing suspiciously after something stinking some­where or other. [10]			臭		stinking, smelly; to emit afoul odor
狗	Dog			gǒu	0232	8	"This is the generic character for dog, indicated by the elements for pack of wild dogs and sentence. Think of the twenty-six let­ters of the alphabet as a pack of wild dogs that run things down in order to work them into sentences. Here they are chasing after your fleet-footed pet terrier. When they catch up with the poor little creature, they circle around it and form themselves into the famous sentence that contains all the letters of the alphabet: ""The quick brown dog jumped over the lazy fox."" [8]"			狗		"dog; [nb: 狗东西, gǒudōngxi, ""That son of a bitch!""]"
厭	to detest			yàn	0233	14	<div><i>Cliff... sun... flesh... chihuahua</i>.</div><div><br /></div>Let the key word suggest someone who has come to detest everything and everything, for whom all the things of life have become meaningless. We are reminded of a vivid image of despair in Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra that makes the character simple to remember.<br />Walking the dark cliffs at midnight, Zarathustra hears a dog (the pooch) howling. He approaches, and under the pale light of the moon he sees a shepherd lad lying on the ground with a thick, black snake hanging out of his mouth (like a long, wag­ging tongue). The snake had crawled in while the lad was asleep, grabbed on to his throat, and held fast. Zarathustra tells the shepherd to bite off the head of the snake and become free of the despair that holds him in tortured captivity, and cease to detest the things of life. [14]			厌		to loathe, dislike, detest
壓	pressure			yā	0234	17	Too much pressure in the classroom not only affects students' ability to learn, but it also has the dangerous effect of leading young children to detest time &quot;wasted&quot; on the playground. If you try to picture the pressure in a literal, not just a psychological sense, the image will be easier to remember. [17]		(jap. simpl.: 圧)	压		to crush, press; to oppress
牛	Cow		"When this character is used as a primitive, the same sense of <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">cow</span> is kept. Note only that when it is placed over another element, its tail is cut off, giving us In this case, and when the element appears on the left (^), the order of the final two strokes is changed."	niú	0235	4	"Can you see the ""doodle"" of a cow that has just been run over by a steamroller? The small dot in the first stroke shows its head turned to one side, and the next two strokes, the four legs. [4]"			牛		ox, cow, bull
特	special			tè	0236	10	Let the key word of this frame refer to something in a special class all its own—like the sacred cows of India that wander freely without fear of being butchered and ground into ham­burger. Even though the practice is originally a Hindu one, and in any case no longer followed among the majority of Mahayana Buddhist monks, the Buddha's refusal to take the life of any sen­tient being makes it only fitting that cows, special as they are, should be placed on the sacred grounds of a Buddhist temple in this character. [10]			特		special (-ly); unusual, unique, extraordinary
告	to declare		Statue of Lenin	gào	0237	7	"Folklore throughout the world tells us of talking animals who show a wisdom superior to that of human beings, and that same tradition has found its way into television shows and cartoons right in our own century. This character depicts a cow with a large mouth that utters, with oracular wisdom, answers to ques­tions posed to her. She begins each reply by opening her mouth wide enough to swallow you whole and stating (in a thick southern drawl),""Aah do declare...T<br>Observe that the stroke order of the cow element changes in the abbreviated form it takes here. [7]"			告		to tell, say, announce, inform
浩	vast			hào	0238	10	The word vast almost inevitably suggests an endless body of water. Only in the case of this character, it is not located in any of the known bodies of water but inside the large mouth of the oracular cow. Take a peek inside and see if you can see the waves splashing against her palate. [10]			浩		extensive, grand; vast (water)
先	before			xiān	0239	6	"Take this key word in its physical, not its temporal, sense (even though it refers to both). If you have a cow with human legs, as the elements show us here, it can only be because you have two people in a cow suit. Who would not prefer to be the one standing before, rather than the one that holds up the rear and becomes the ""butt"" of everyone's laughter! [6]"	"(not ""in front of"")"		先		early; prior; former; in advance; first
洗	to wash			xǐ	0240	9	"This character is so logical that one is tempted to let the ele­ments speak for themselves: water... before. Let's see what we can do to make it more memorable.<br>We all know the parental insistence inflicted on children, ""Wash your hands before you come to the table."" At some point, your mom gets so fed up with repeating it that she calls in a plumber to fix a small water spigot to the edge of the table in front of each chair. Mom dutifully washes her own hands to drop the hint, and everyone does the same in turn. Of course, we would end up with wet laps and water all over the floor, but at least everyone's hands would be clean. [9]"			洗		to wash, cleanse, purify; to bathe
介	to introduce			jiè	0241	4	"The right way to enter a new situation is to have someone politely introduce you, so that you don t feel that you are intrud­ing. This character shows a walking stick being introduced into an umbrella frame by someone shoving it into an already occu­pied slot in the umbrella stand at the door. First notice the ver­tical strokes: on the left is the curved umbrella handle, and on the right the straight walking stick. Now try to imagine the two parties tugging at their respective properties like two kids on a wishbone, creating a scene at the entrance of an elegant restau­rant. So much for polite ""introductions."" [4]"	(not&nbsp;<i>acquaint</i>)		介		to introduce; to lie between; between
界	World			jiè	0242	9	"Whoever it is that decides to introduce the construction of more and more buildings in our cities as ""development proj­ects' should be held accountable someday for what a mess we are making of the natural world, not to mention the living and working conditions of those who populate them. From a bird's-eye view, this glass-and-cement jungle begins to look more and more like a gigantic checkerboard (replacing the neatly partitioned rice fields). If you look closely at the character, you should be able to see a kind of movement taking place as still more buildings are being introduced into already cramped spaces. [9]"			界		boundary, scope, extent
茶	Tea			chá	0243	10	As everyone knows, tea is made from tea leaves. But the tea plant itself has its own flowers, which can be quite beautiful and add a special flavor to the tea, as the Chinese found out over 4,600 years ago. With the image of a terrace of flowering tea bushes in mind, picture a number of brightly painted and very 1-o-n-g wooden poles (frame 191) placed here and there in their midst, with an umbrella at the top of each of them to shade the delicate-tasting tea flowers. [10]			茶		tea; tea plant
會	Meeting			huì	0244	13	Here is the full character for the primitive element introduced in the previous frame. The two added elements below, the brains impaled on the horns of a dilemma (see frame 172) and tongues wagging in the mouths create a memorable, and accu­rate, description of a lot of meetings. [13]			会		to meet, assemble, gather; group; association; ALSO: can, be able
合	to fit			hé	0245	6	The character for fit reads literally, top to bottom, as a meeting of mouths—which is a rather descriptive way of speaking of a romantic kiss. We ail know what happens when there is no meeting of minds and when peoples ideas don't fit with one another. But this character invites us to imagine what hap­pened to the romance of a certain unfortunate couple whose mouths didn't fit. [6]			合		to fit, suit; to join, combine; to close, shut (eg: book)
哈	Ha!			hā	0246	9	"This is a ""sound character* for the sound of laughter. Write it twice and it is read—what else!—ha-ha. Now nothing fits the human mouth better than a good laugh, one of the few things that separate us scientifically from other primates. Can it be accidental that the sound of laughter is universal across lan­guages? Another reason to say that it fits the mouth perfectly. [9]"			哈		[ the sound of laughter]
塔	Pagoda			tǎ	0247	13	<div><i>Soil</i>...<i>kaleidoscope</i></div><div><br /></div>On the left we see a mound of dirt and on the right, flowers made to fit together. The two combine to create a great pagoda made of dirt, with flowers by the tens of thousands made to fit together for the roofing of each of the layers. Be sure to put yourself in the scene and fit a few of the flowers in place yourself so that the image works its way into memory with full force. [13]			塔		pagoda; tower
王	King		As a primitive, this character can mean either <i>king</i> or <i>scep­ter</i>, but it will usually be taken to mean <i>jewel</i> or <i>ball</i> (from the characters introduced in the following two frames.).	wáng	0248	4	See what you can do to come up with a pictograph of a king's scepter here that suits your own idea of what it should look like. You might even begin with the basic element for I-beam and then try to fit the remaining third stroke in. [4]			王		king, monarch
玉	Jade		When this character is used as a primitive and retains its original shape, it will keep the original meaning of <i>jade</i>. When it appears on the left, however, it will be lacking the final stroke, making it the same as the character in the pre­vious frame, I. In such cases, its meaning will be <i>jewel</i> or <i>ball</i>	yù	0249	5	Note the drop here in the king's scepter, which is exactly what you would expect it to be: a gold staff with a large jade jewel on the handle, a symbol of his wealth and power. [5]			玉		jade
球	Balls			qiú	0250	11	Immediately we introduce the primitive element for ball and we meet the full character for ball on which it is based. As an aid to remembering it, think of a catcher signaling the pitcher his request not for a strike but for a ball. As if he was going to throw his glove or his hat. What else can the pitcher throw? Heaven only knows what Alexander Cartwright was smoking when he gave it that name. [11]			球		ball; sphere
現	present			xiàn	0251	11	"Do not think of a ""gift"" here, but of the present time, as distinct from the future and the past. The character gives us a ball in which we see the present moment—obviously a crystal ball that enables us to see things going on at the present time in faraway places. [11]"	(time)		现		present; now; existing; current
玩	to play			wán [普], wàn [國]	0252	8	"The very first game people played dates back to the beginning of creation, in the Garden of Paradise. For those who see it as a story of original sin, it went something like the game children play called ""hot potato."" You take a ball and pass it around as quickly as possible until someone drops the ball&gt; thereby los­ing. In the case of Adam and Eve, it was a piece of fruit from the forbidden tree. ""Its not mine, its his """"No it's not, she had it first...."" In any case, if you see an original sin in all of this, then both of them clearly dropped the ball for the rest of us. [8]"	(<u>not</u> <i>to play with</i>)		玩		to play, amuse oneself; to play jokes
狂	crazy			kuáng	0253	7	"We sometimes refer to people or ideas that are crazy as being ""looney,"" which literally means driven mad by the light of the moon. The most famous of the ""looneys"" are the legendary lycanthropes or ""wolfmen."" Sometimes the transformation is only a temporary phenomenon; sometimes it is permanent. In the latter case, the poor chap takes off on all fours to live with the beasts. To remember this character, imagine one of these lycanthropes going crazy and setting himself up as king of a pack of wild dogs that roams about and terrorizes innocent sub­urban communities. [7]"			狂		crazy, insane, mad; conceited, arrogant
皇	Emperor			huáng	0254	9	"An emperor, as we all know, is a ruler—something like a king but higher in status. The white bird perched above the king, ele­vating him to ""imperial"" heights, is the messenger the emperor sends back and forth to the gods to request advice and special favors, something that white birds have long done in folklore throughout the world. [9]"			皇		emperor; royal, imperial
煌	resplendent			huáng	0255	13	"In this character we see a. fire-emperor, resplendent in his glory. He is not an emperor who rules over fire, but one made of fire. His speeches, his temper, his eyes—everything about him is ""fiery"" [13] "			煌		brilliant, bright, shining, luminous
呈	to submit		❖ Note that when this character is used as a primitive, in some fonts the first stroke of king is drawn from right to left and slanting downwards, replacing the usual horizontal stroke shown here, drawn left to right.	chéng	0256	7	"The trick to remembering this character lies in associating the key word submit with the line from the nursery rhyme about four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie: ""Wasn't this a dainty dish to set before the king?"" If we think of submit as ""setting before"" or ""presenting to,"" then all we have to do to complete the picture is imagine a king with his head thrown back and his mouth wide open as twenty-four blackbirds fly in one after the other. Dainty? [7]"			呈		to submit, present (eg: a report); to petition
全	whole			quán	0257	6	"Being whole suggests physical and spiritual health,""having ones act together."" This character compares being whole to ""being king under ones own umbrella"" that is, giving order to ones own life. Granted it sounds terribly abstract, but what could be more abstract than the word whole? [6]"			全		all, whole, entire, complete
理	Logic			lǐ	0258	11	We first referred to this character back in frame 169 to which you might want to return to have a peek. The image of logic we are given is something like a central jewel in a computer, like the jewels in old clocks that keep them running smoothly. Try to picture yourself making your way through all the rams and roms and approaching this shining jewely a chorus of voices and a blast of trumpets in the background heralding the great seat of all-knowing logic. [11]			理		reason; logic; science; inner principle
主	Lord		"When using this character as a primitive element, we set the key word aside entirely and take it as a pictograph of a solid brass <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">candlestick</span> (with the drop representing the flame at the top)."	zhǔ	0259	5	"""A mans home is his castle,"" goes the proverb from an age where it was the male who was lord of the household. Fundamentally, it means only that every one of us is a bit (or drop) of a king in our own environment. As for the positioning of the elements, if you take care to ""read off"" the primitives in this way, you wont end up putting the drop down below, where it turns the charac­ter into jade. [5]"			主		master; lord; host
注	to pour			zhù	0260	8	Picture yourself trying to hold your hand steady as you pour water from a lighted candlestick. What could be more ridicu­lous, or simpler, as a way to recall this character? [8]			注		to inject; to pour into
金	the Gold		"When this character is used as a primitive, it means not only <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">gold</span> but any <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">metal</span> at all."	jīn	0261	8	If this were not one of the most common characters you will ever have to write, we would apologize for having to give the explanation that follows. Anyway, we want to depict bars of gold bullion with an umbrella overhead to shade them from the heat (and perhaps to hide them as well). The bullion is made by melting down all the scepters of the kingdom, drop by drop, and shaping them into bars. [8]			金		metal; money; gold
銅	Copper			tóng	0262	14	"Picture an order of monks serving as chaplains for the police force. Their special habit, made of protective metal, is distin­guished by a row of copper buttons just like the ""cops"" they . serve. [14]"			铜		copper
釣	to go fishin’			diào	0263	11	"The character we learned for fishing (frame 165) refers to the professional, net-casting industry, while the key word in this frame, go fishirf, is related to the pastime or sport. The odd thing is that your' go-fishin "" rod is a golden ladle which you are using to scoop goldfish out of a river. [11]"			钓		to fish, go fishing
針	Needle			zhēn	0264	10	In frame 10 we referred ahead to this full character from which the primitive for needle (on the right) derives. Since we alread expect that needles are made of metal, let us picture a set of solid gold darning needles to complete the character. [10]	(full character)		针		needle, pin; injection
釘	Nail			dīng	0265	10	Here we have the full character for nail from which the primi­tive element of the same meaning derived (see frame 86). As long as you picture the nail as made of pure gold and bending out of shape ever time you try to hammer it, you should have no trouble remembering it. [10]	(full character)		钉		nail, spike
銘	Inscription			míng	0266	14	Take inscription in the sense of the name you ask the jeweler to carve on a gold bracelet or inside a gold ring to identify its owner or communicate some sentimental message. It will help if you can recall the first time you had this done and the feelings you had at the time. [14]		A golden ring with %USERNAME% written on it	铭		inscribed motto; to engrave
鎮	at ease			zhèn	0267	18	The first lie-detector machines of the twentieth century worked by wiring pieces of metal to the body to measure the amount of sweat produced when questions were asked. It was discov­ered that nervousness produced more sweat, indicating subcon­scious reactions when the true facts of the matter were getting too close for comfort. The only way to beat the apparatus is to have complete control over yourself and remain perfectly at ease. Picture yourself trying to do it while the examiners ask questions guaranteed to extract buckets of sweat from you. [18]			镇		calm, cool, composed; to ease or relieve pain
道	Way			dào	0268	12	The key word carries both the sense of a road or way for transit and a way or method of doing something. The primitives here read: heads and road. YouVe probably heard about companies cleaning house and threatening that &quot;heads are going to roll.&quot; Well, here is the road they are rolling on. If you want, think of it as the Way of the Bottom Line. [12]			道		way, path, road; method, principle; truth, Tao
導	to guide			dǎo	0269	15	When we allow someone to guide us, we permit ourselves to be glued to a certain way of doing something, and try to &quot;stick to it. [15]			导		to lead; to guide; to conduct
迅	speedy			xùn	0270	6	This character shows a Speedy Gonzales wanna-be tearing down the highway in his '57 Chevy, only to be brought to an abrupt halt by the highway police who have scattered hooks and needles across the road to puncture his tires. [6]		卂 [xùn] (to hover, to fly quickly; phonetic component)<br />A picture of a flying bird, simpler than 飞(飛) fēi.	迅		rapid
造	to create			zào	0271	10	We sometimes think of create as meaning to make something out of nothing. Most of the time, however, there is something there to begin with, and often what is created doesn't amount to much of an improvement. Like politicians invoking the right of eminent domain to declare that a road will be built across the farmland that has been in your family for two hundred years. Some &quot;creation.&quot; [10]			造		to make; to build; to invent
巡	to patrol			xún	0272	6	The motorcycle police, exercising their duty to patrol the high-ways, are pictured in this character as a virtual flood washing down a road. [6]		road patrol in Venice 	巡		to patrol; to make one's rounds
逛	to stroll			guàng	0273	10	A crazy person decides to stroll down the middle of a very busy road during rush hour. [10]			逛		to stroll; to visit
車	Car		"❖ <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">Car</span>, <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">cart</span>, <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">wagon</span>, and <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">vehicle</span> may all be used as primitive meanings."	chē	0274	7	You may keep the whole range of connotations for this key word, car, provided it does not interfere with the pictograph. Look for the front and back axles (the first and last horizontal strokes) and the seat in the carriage in the middle. [7]			车		car, vehicle; machine
連	one after another			lián	0275	10	Imagine a convoy of large vehicles transporting heavy construc­tion equipment. They are following one after another and hog­ging the entire road for miles on end. [10]			连		successively
蓮	Lotus			lián	0276	14	Imagine yourself sitting on the edge of a lotus pond in the early morning as the pink and white lotus flowers softly pop into bloom, one after another. Given the subtlety of sound they make, it is no surprise that the opening of the lotus flower has served Buddhist monks for centuries as an image of the moment of spiritual enlightenment. [14]			莲		lotus, water lily; paradise
前	in front		"Following the explanation above, when this character is used as a primitive, the meaning will be a <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">butcher shop</span>."	qián	0277	9	Picture a pair of horns (borrowed from a Texas steer) hanging in front of a butchers shop. [9]			前		in front, forward; earlier, preceding
剪	Shears			jiǎn	0278	11	Here, weld together a pair of daggers to make some meat shears for use in the butcher shop. [11]	"(not <i>sheaf</i><span style=""font-size:small; vertical-align:sub;"">(p)</span>)"		剪		scissors; cut with scissors
輸	to transport			shū	0279	16	Usually we employ vehicles to transport refrigerated meats, but here we have an entire slaughterhouse that is being carried across the country on wheels. [16]			输		transport, carry, haul
逾	to exceed			yú	0280	12	The road to the slaughterhouse is a two-lane, one-way highway, crowded with animals of all sizes approaching their doomsday. To accommodate the chickens, the speed limit is set at 2 mph. A motorcycle cop drives up and down warning the buffalo and ostriches not to exceed the speed limit. [12]	(<u>not</u> <i>Excess</i>, <u>not</u> <i>to surpass</i>)		逾		to exceed, go beyond; to jump over
各	each		"❖ The sense of the proverb should help when using this char--------^nro it tn itc original ele­ments. But do not associate it in any way with the word ""every,"" which we shall meet later in another context."	gè	0281	6	"""Suum cuique"" goes the popular Latin proverb. A certain disease of the English language makes it almost impossible to translate the phrase without gender bias. In any event, here we see some­one walking with his/her mouth between his/her walking legs, giving us an image of ""To each his/her own."" [6]"			各		each; every
格	Pattern			gé	0282	10	To each tree its own pattern. Think of the key word as refer­ring to the patterns on an array of Hawaiian shirts that you are dressing up the trees in your garden with to give to each its own identity and keep them distinct from one another. Take a moment to admire the whole fashion show. [10]			格		pattern, standard, form; style
客	Guest			kè	0283	9	When you are a guest in a courteous town, each household has its own way of welcoming you, and each house becomes your home. [9]			客		visitor, guest; customer
額	Forehead			é	0284	18	As Miss Manners will be the first to tell you, out of respect one does not look straight into the eyes of ones guests of honor, but focuses on the knots of their neckties. Here, however, you are told to look at the upper part of the head, to the forehead of your guest. [18]			额		forehead; tablet, plaque; fixed
夏	Summer			xià	0285	10	In the summer, fatigued by the heat, you have devised a creative and energy-saving fan: you have hired a couple of racewalking stars in training for the summer Olympics, stuck their noses to the ceiling, and asked them to practice by moving their walking legs around quickly in mid-air, giving you a fresh breeze and enhancing their chances of picking up a medal. [10]			夏		summer
洛	L.A.			luò	0286	9	The key word (the well-known abbreviation of the city of Los Angeles) represents one of the important uses of this character in Chinese, namely, as the first character in the full compound for Los Angeles. How do we get from each drop of water to the city of L.A.? Think of what happens to the moisture in the air over that city. To each droplet of water is added its own particle of pollutant. Hence the gray blanket of smog that hangs over that unfortunate symbol of industrial devastation. [9]			洛		"the ""Luò"" river in Shanxi Prv."
落	to fall			luò	0287	13	One of the worst consequences of the smog in cities like L. A. is that the petals of flowers exposed to the open air fall before their time—good news for the artificial/tower industry, but bad news for those who prefer the real thing. [13]			落		to fall, drop
冗	superfluous			rǒng	0288	4	A crown is supposed to be a sign of leadership, wisdom, and nobility. Without those virtues, it is a superfluous symbol, as in the case of the royal airhead depicted in this character. You can actually see the wind blowing between his ears. [4]			冗		extraneous
沉	profound			chén	0289	7	See the philosopher lost in profound speculation on matters metaphysical, the drops of water on his forehead showing the intensity of his concentration, and the accusation of his more pragmatic neighbors that the whole thing is profoundly superfluous. [7]			沉		deep, profound; to lower, submerge, immerse
軍	Army		❖ Used as a primitive this character means only chariot	jūn	0290	9	"The crowned vehicle depicted here is a ""chariot,"" symbol of a Caesars army. [9]"			军		army, military; soldiers, troops
輝	Radiance			huī	0291	15	Take advantage of the first syllable of the key word to think of the ray of light to the left. Now add the glittering chariot that is emitting those rays and you have radiance. [15]	(<u>not</u> <i>Ray</i>)		辉		brightness, luster, brilliance
運	to carry			yùn	0292	12	"A row of ""sweet"" chariots ""swinging low"" to our roads is a sure sign that, as the old southern spiritual has it, the Lord is ""comin' for to carry us home."" [12]"			运		to move, transport
冠	Crown			guān	0293	9	By having the crown pass from one age to the next, a people keeps itself glued to its beginnings. [9]	(full character)		冠		crown; cap, hat, crest
夢	a Dream			mèng	0294	14	"To have a dream after going to bed is really the crown to a per­fect evening. The flower petals over the eyes (instead of the ""sand"" that Westerners are used to finding there when they awake in the morning) only confirm the image of a pleasant dream suggested by the rest of this rather complex character. [14]"		The flower petals over the eyes: the crown to a per­fect evening. 	梦		dream, visionary; wishful
坑	Pit			kēng	0295	7	A whirlwind begins to dig its way into the soil like a drill until it makes a deep pit. [7]	"(full character, not the radical 17 ""pit"")"		坑		pit; to defraud
高	tall		"♦ As a primitive, this character keeps its sense of tall and its position at the top of other primitives, but its writing is abbreviated in one of two forms: when drawn with only the first five strokes (*), it keeps the generic meaning of tall but when the next two strokes are added (*) it will mean a tall <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">tiara</span>, since the element for <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">hood</span> is compressed into the form or a <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">crown</span>."	gāo	0296	10	Recalling an image from frame 178, first see the mouth under the extraterrestrial's transparent helmet, and then the mouth under the top hat of one of his mates who has tried on the top hat only to find that this strange earthlings' headgear makes him look much, much taller than everyone else. [10]			高		high; tall
享	to enjoy			xiǎng	0297	8	While the other children enjoy themselves at hopscotch and jacks, this one, a tall child—-but a really tall child, 11 feet 4 inches and only in second grade—enjoys herself at less terres­trial play: peeping into bird nests, chatting up the giraffes at the zoo, and high-jumping over the pole-vault bar. [8]			享		enjoy
熟	ripe			shú	0298	15	When fruit is ripe and in season, we can't get enough of it. The problem is, we want to enjoy the taste of ripe peaches and man­gos all year round. What we have here is a bottle of pills distilled from ripe fruit, after stewing for hours over a cooking firey into &quot;essence of peach&quot; and &quot;essence of mango.&quot; Enjoy them when­ever you want. [15]			熟		ripe; done; cooked
亭	Pavilion			tíng	0299	9	Think of all the <b>pavilions</b> at County Fairs or World Expos you have wandered into or seen advertised in the media, and you will no doubt see rising up among them the towering <i>spike</i> of a structure with a revolving restaurant at the top—often the only <b>pavilion</b> to survive the event. The difference here is that the restaurant is in the shape of a high, bejeweled golden <i>tiara</i>. [9]			亭		pavilion
亮	shining			liàng	0300	9	To restore those musty old tiaras in the museum back to their original shiny luster, it occurs to you to try an air blaster. Picture yourself with a tank of compressed air strapped to your back, protective goggles over your eyes, and nozzle in hand. As you approach the row of irreplaceable treasures, you squeeze the trigger and a hurricane-force wind sends the whole display fly­ing against the far wall and landing in a heap of junk. [9]			亮		light; bright
京	Capital		"❖ As a primitive element, this character will take the meaning of a <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">capitol building</span>."	jīng	0301	8	When you think of a capital city, think of the tally domed capi­tal building with swarms of small folk gathered around its base, probably demonstrating for their governments attention. [8]			京		capital; Beijing (abbrev.)
涼	cool			liáng	0302	11	Here we see a capitol building getting a cool shower (the drops of water)y probably because some politician has done some­thing scandalous again. [11]			凉		cool; cold
景	Scenery			jǐng	0303	12	Scenery is depicted as a sun rising over a capitol bwi Wing, which is as close as some city dwellers get to natural scenery for years at a time! [12]			景		scenery, circumstance
就	at once			jiù	0304	12	The key word at once suggests an order to be carried out imme­diately. In this case, it is our little Frankenpooch being sum­moned to come at once to the capitol building to testify before a subcommittee on organized crime in the canine world. [12]			就		at once, right away
周	Circumference		"❖ As a primitive, this character can take the added signifi­cance of a <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">lap</span>."	zhōu	0305	8	Look more closely at your lidded crock and you will see little ruler marks along its bottom edge. This is so you can use it to calculate the circumference of your motorcycle helmet: just begin at a fixed point and turn the lidded crock around and around, keeping it flush against the side of the helmet, until you come back to your starting point. If you kept track of how many turns and part-turns your lidded crock made, you now know the circumference. [8]			周		circuit, lap, cycle; encircle
週	Week			zhōu	0306	11	Picture a circular road with seven markers on it, one for each day of the week. When you have walked one complete lap on this road, you shall have completed one week. [11]			周		week; cycle
士	Soldier			shì	0307	3	The shape of this character, slightly differing from that for soil by virtue of its shorter final stroke, hints at a broad-shouldered, slender-waisted soldier standing at attention. [3]			士		warrior, soldier, knight; scholar; expert
吉	lucky		"❖ When this character is used as a primitive, we shall take this shape to mean an <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">aerosol can</span>, from the <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">mouth</span> and the very tight-fitting <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">lid</span> (note how it differs here from the <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">lidded</span> crock)."	jí	0308	6	Here we see a statue of the famous Soldier of Good Fortune, G. L. (&quot;Good Luck&quot;) Joe, standing on a street with a gigantic open mouth. Every day people walk up to and stick their heads down deep inside. As the superstition goes, G. L. Joe will make this their lucky day. [6]			吉		lucky; Jilin Prv. (abbrev.)
買	to buy			mǎi	0309	12	We have waited to introduced this character here because it forms a pair with the following frame. Depicted here is a woman at a fish market to buy some quality oysters. You should be able to see her eyeball right down on one of the oysters, examining its quality at close range. [12]			买		to buy, purchase
賣	to sell			mài	0310	15	The companion character to buy is that for sell. The only dif­ference is the soldier watching the person eyeing something to buy, just to be sure that everything is properly paid for. [15]			卖		to sell
書	Book			shū	0311	10	The sage talks rapidly with his tongue wagging in his mouth, while the brush of the scribe runs apace to write down the mas­ter s words in a book for posterity.<br />Just as the stroke order changed in the abbreviated form that cow took as a primitive (frame 235), here, too, the last two strokes of the element for brush are drawn in a sequence differ­ent from that of the frame above. [10]			书		book, letter, document; writings
畫	a Drawing			huà	0312	12	The character for drawing begins, logically enough, with a brush But what in heaven's name, you ask, are those brains doing lying on the floor&quot;? We leave the rest of the story of you. [12]		&quot;Draw boundary lines...delineate, draw, paint; drawing, painting; stroke (in writing) -- 聿 to draw 凵 or 一 lines: boundaries of a 田 field&quot; --Karlgren.<br />        An old form is 畵. In the common full form 畫, the bottom 凵 is reduced to 一.<br />        In the simple form 画 the top 聿 is left out.<br />        Compare 昼(晝) zhòu which is similiar to 画(畫) in the full form.<br />	画		a painting, picture, drawing; to draw
劃	to scratch			huá, huà	0313	14	Remember the game where one child would scratch a drawing of something on another kids back to see if she could guess what it was?

救	to rescue			jiù	0317	11	"Usually it is the school taskmaster who is requesting something or other of us, but here you are drowning in the swimming pool and the only one around is that most dreaded of all your cur-ricular taskmasters, your English poetry teacher. You carefully parse your words: ""I respectfully request that you rescue me immediately."" [11]"			救		to save; to assist; to rescue
敬	to revere			jìng	0318	13	In front of someone you revere, you get self-conscious and may try to speak in flowery sentences. The taskmaster at the right is drilling you in the practice of &quot;polite language.&quot; [13]	(<u>not</u> <i>to venerate</i>)		敬		to respect, venerate, revere; to salute
敞	spacious			chǎng	0319	12	The leap from esteem and taskmaster to spacious seems huge, but if we associate the key word with the song &quot;America the Beautiful,&quot; it becomes but a small step. &quot;O beautiful for spa­cious skies...&quot; begin the well-known lyrics that esteem the natu­ral beauties with which the country has been blessed. But then, directly in the second stanza, the song enjoins the country to &quot;Confirm thy soul in self-control,&quot; reminding us of the need to be taskmasters over our selfish appetites. [12]			敞		spacious; uncovered
言	to say		"❖ When this character is used as a primitive, it will often be given the meaning of <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">words</span>."	yán	0320	7	Of all the things we can do with our mouths, speech is the one that requires the greatest distinctness and clarity. Hence the character for say has four little sound waves, indicating the complexity of the achievement. (The hand-drawn form, unlike the printed form, begins with something like a top hat.) [7]	(words)		言		to speak; to say; talk; word
警	Police			jǐng	0321	20	For all the negative things some people have to say about the police, when they get pulled over on the highway, chances are they bite their tongues and make a special effort to revere the officers' words, hoping to get off with just a warning. [20]			警		guard, watch; alert, alarm
計	a Plan			jì	0322	9	Words and a needle combine to form the character for a plan.

獄	Prison			yù	0323	14	Here we have a typical scene in a high-security prison for the scum of the canine world: a weak and vulnerable chihuahua (doing time for insider trading) surrounded on the prison yard by a ferocious looking pack of wild dogs (all of them long-tim­ers and hardened criminals). The only thing the chihuahua has to protect himself from the pack are his shrill and frightened words. [14]			狱		prison, jail; case; lawsuit
討	to condemn			tǎo	0324	10	Words spoken to condemn us stick to us like glue in a way no other words can. [10]	(<u>not</u> <i>to accuse</i>)		讨		to ask for, demand; to send a punitive expedition
訓	Instruction			xùn	0325	10	"The personalism connoted by the word instruction, as opposed to ""teaching"" or ""discipline,"" suits the picture here of words guid­ing ones progress like the gentle flowing of a stream. Even the etymology of the word instruction suggests the sense of ""pour­ing into"". [10]"			训		instruction, example, pattern; to teach, train
話	the Talk			huà	0326	13	"That the words of the tongue should form the character for talk is no surprise. Think of the phrase, ""He's all talk,"" and a story should not be far behind. [13]"			话		spoken words, speech, talk, conversation; dialect; language
詩	Poem			shī	0327	13	Since silence is treasured so highly at a Buddhist temple, the words spoken there must be well chosen. Perhaps this is why the records of the monks often read to us like poems. [13]			诗		poem; poetry, verse, ode
語	Language			yǔ	0328	14	Whereas the character for say and talk (frames 320 and 326) focused on the actual talking, the character for language stresses the fact that although it is I (remember: the literary I) who use them, the words of a language are not my own. [14]			语		language, words; saying, expression

談	to discuss			tán	0331	15	"In attempts to discuss an issue, the fervor of one's convictions can come to the surface and create an inflammation of words (if you will, the ""cuss"" in discuss). [15]"	(<u>not</u> <i>debate</i>)		谈		to converse, chat
這	this			zhè	0332	10	When you are driving along, you sometimes see words written on the road before you, usually telling to stop or yield or slow down or watch out for something or other. In this case, we see only the word This written in giant white letters. Imagine the scene, and the confusion it would cause you for hours after­wards. [10]			这		this; these
式	Style			shì	0333	6	Take style in its sense of some fashion design or model. Then let the element arrow and work stand for the well-known style of shirts known as &quot;Arrow shirts&quot; because of the little arrow sewn on each one. [6]			式		type; form; pattern; style
試	Test			shì	0334	13	When a manufacturer produces a new <i>style</i> for the market, the first thing that is done is to run a <b>test</b> on consumers, asking them to <i>say</i> frankly what they think about the product. Never mind the anachronism (the character was there well before our capitalistic market system) if it helps you remember. [13]	(not <i>take an exam</i>)		试		to test, try; test, experiment
戈	Halberd		"❖ When this character is used as a primitive, we will revert to a friendler meaning. Think of the third stroke as a kind of deocrative tassle fixed to the shaft of an arrow to indicate that it is no longer a weapon but a symbol of a <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">fiesta</span>."	gē	0335	4	A halberd is a kind of lance made up of a long, arrowhead-shaped pike with two curved blades below it. If you don t have one in your closet, you might consult a dictionary. [4]			戈		spear, lance, halberd
或	or			huò	0336	8	"Unless you were one of those saintly children who always did what they were told, you should have no trouble associating the key word in this frame with the stern warning of a parent or teacher to do something—""or else!"" Here we see a rather grim depiction of the or else: you are lying down with your mouth on the floor (an inventive substitute to wearing a dunce-cap and sitting in the corner) while everyone else is out enjoying the fiesta.<br />Just as the phrase ""or else"" does not necessarily imply dire con­sequences but can be used as a simple indication of an alterna­tive, so, too, this character is a simple conjunction. Pay special attention to the stroke order. [8]"			或		or, else; perhaps, maybe
賊	Burglar			zéi	0337	13	From a burglar's point of view, a fiesta is an occasion to take out the old lock-picking needle and break into the unattended sale filled with the family shells (the old form of money, as we saw in frames 76 and 77). [13]			贼		thief; traitor
載	laden			zài	0338	13	It is not hard to think of the folks from the Little House on the Prairie riding a cart laden to overflowing with all the trim­mings of a great Thanksgiving feast. [13]			载		load; carry; transport, convey
鐵	Iron			tiě	0339	21	You submit a bar of iron to the annual Thanksgiving contest for the thing for which the town is most thankful. At first, everyone laughs at you, but when the judges stop to think of how impor­tant it is for so many of the things we depend on, iron wins the gold medal. [21]			铁		iron; strong, solid,
茂	lush			mào	0340	9	The sense of the key word lush is that of something growing luxuriously, though not necessarily in excess-in this case a whole parade of weeds (outcast flowers). By way of exception, the flowers take their normal place over the enclosure. [9]			茂		luxuriant
成	to turn into		T-образный перегонный аппарат	chéng	0341	6	"Let the phrase ""turn into"" suggest some sort of a magical change. What happens here is that the parade marching down main street turns into a dogger-throwing bout between competing bands. Note how only one stroke has to be added to make the change. [6]"			成		become, turn into; completed, finished
城	City			chéng	0342	9	In this frame, we see a mound of dirt that is being turned into the walls of a city (the way you may have built a sand castle as a child playing on the beach). [9]			城		city walls; city, town
誠	sincere			chéng	0343	13	The sure test of how sincere you are is whether or not your words are being turned into deeds. [13]			诚		honest; sincere; true
威	Might&nbsp;&nbsp;[ie: Power]			wēi	0344	9	Here we see a march of women demonstrating on behalf of equal rights, a show of might not always welcome to the male chauvinist population. [9]			威		power, might, prestige
滅	to destroy			miè	0345	13	Picture a march of flames demonstrating against the Fire Department for their right to destroy, but being doused with water by the police riot squads. [13]			灭		extinguish; wipe out, exterminate
咸	everybody			xián	0346	9	Reading this character off literally, we have mouths on the march. Now as the song reminds us, &quot;Everybody needs some­body sometime.&quot; Here, quite literally, the marching mouths are desperately in need of some body. (For that matter, everyBODY needs a mouth.) Imagine them singing the song and you should feel a twinge of pity that will stick this character in memory. [9]			咸		all, everyone; together; united
減	to reduce			jiǎn	0347	12	A group of unquenchable mouths sets out on a march across the country, drinking water wherever they can find it, until their imbibitions reduce the water supply to a trickle, trigger­ing a national disaster. Of course, you are free to create your own image with the primitives water and everybody. [12]			减		decrease, subtract, diminish
單	a List			dān	0348	12	"The chatterbox should let you know what kind of a list this key<br>word refers to: an auctioneer's list of items to be sold to the<br>highest bidder. Now all you need to do is imagine that the brain<br>of each of the bidders in the audience has a little meter in it with<br>a needle bobbing back and forth between ""buy"" and ""pass"" as the<br>bids continue to rise.<br>Be careful of the writing here. The brain shares a stroke with<br>the needle, which means that the order of writing is thrown off<br>a bit. [12]"			单		bill, list, form; single, sole, only
戰	War			zhàn	0349	16	Victory in war is commonly celebrated as a national fiesta— until a knock comes at the door informing your family that the younger brother or son whose return you are awaiting is on the list of those who will be returning in a pine box. [16]			战		war; battle; to fight
錢	Coin			qián	0350	16	Those special gold-colored tokens minted each year for the Mardi Gras and thrown into the crowds by people on the floats give us the character for coins. [16]			钱		coin, money, currency,
淺	shallow			qiǎn	0351	11	An entourage of floats going from one town to the next must always seek a shallow place to cross the water. Try to picture what happens if they don't. [11]			浅		shallow, not deep; superficial
賤	cheap			jiàn	0352	15	When the town tightwad agrees to enter a float in the annual parade, he first calculates how many clams it is going to set him back and then starts pinching pennies to make it as cheap as possible. [15]			贱		inexpensive, cheap, worthless; lowly
止	to stop		❖ Although the meaning of stop will be retained, we will return often to the pictographic meaning of footprint. When the last two strokes are moved to look like this At, it means a whole trail of footprints, as you might find on the beach. We will not see an example of this until frame 973.	zhǐ	0353	4	The character for stop is easiest to learn as a pictograph, though you have to take a moment to see it. Take it as a rather crude drawing of a footprint, the track that is left when your foot has stopped long enough to make an impression. The first three strokes represent the front of the foot and the last one, the heel. The big toe (the second stroke sticking out to the right) indi­cates that this is a left foot. [4]			止		to stop, halt, prohibit
步	Footstep			bù	0354	7	Footprints that follow one another a few at a time indicate foot­steps. Don t forget what we mentioned back in frame 104 about the abbreviation of the element for few when it appears under another element. [7]			步		a step; stages in a process
涉	to ford			shè	0355	10	One way to ford a body of water is to wade across it on foot You need to take your footsteps one after the other, but unlike a stroll on dry land, you have to be careful to keep your balance and not end up in the water. Remember what is feels like to walk gingerly on the slippery bottom of a shallow stream, calculating your every footstep as you go. [10 ]			涉		ford stream, wade across
頻	repeatedly			pín	0356	16	The image of something occurring repeatedly, over and over again, is of having ones head walked on, a succession of foot­steps trampling on your cranium. [16]			频		frequently; repetitious
肯	to agree			kěn	0357	8	Seeing footprints on someone's flesh indicates a rather brutal way of having persuaded that person to agree. [8]			肯		to agree; to consent; willing
企	to look forward to			qǐ [普], qì [國]	0358	6	"Who doesn't look forward to stopping under a large beach umbrella for a day of relaxation and ""dolce far niente""? [6]"	(<u>not</u> <i>to be about to</i>)		企		plan a project; stand on tiptoe
歲	Years of Age			suì	0359	13	The character indicating one's years of age pictures &amp; few foot­prints marching along,. No feet, just the footprints. [13]			岁		age, years, years old
武	military			wǔ	0360	8	Think of the 24-hour clock, also known as &quot;military time,&quot; as a watch face whose numbers actually go from 1 to 24, but which has only the hour hand on it (the elements for one and arrow), due to cutbacks in military expenditure. Now all you have to do is find a way to introduce the element that can mean either stop or footprint Be sure to retain a military flavor in your image. [8]			武		martial; military
賦	Levy			fù	0361	15	A levy can be imposed for any number of reasons, but here it is pictured as a certain number of clams (money) collected by the powers that be to offset current military expenses—presumably so they can get back the minute hand for watches like the one in the last frame. [15]			赋		tax, taxation; bestow on, endow with
正	correct			zhèng	0362	5	"""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,"" says _1—_&amp;<br />the Chinese proverb. Here we see one footprint, complement­ing that proverb with the sound advice that if the first step is not correct, the rest of the journey will be off track. This is the ideal that teachers are supposed to have in correcting their stu­dents, and parents in correcting their children. [5]"			正		right, proper, correct; to correct
政	Politics			zhèng	0363	9	To the many definitions for politics that already exist, this char­acter offers yet another: correct taskmastering. When those in politics twist this ideal and start maneuvering people to their own advantage, it is time to elect a correct taskmaster. [9]	(<u>not</u> <i>govern</i>)		政		politics; government; political
定	to settle on			dìng	0364	8	To settle on, in the sense of deciding on a certain course of action, is likened here to mending ones house. [8]			定		to determine, decide, settle on
走	to walk			zǒu	0365	7	To walk, we are told here, has the effect of mending the soil. If you consider what driving an automobile over the soil does to it, taking more time off to walk might not be a bad idea.<br>Note that the final stroke of soil doubles up with the first stroke of mending. Of course, you could also use soil and trail of footprints as the primitive elements, but if you do, youre on your own. [7]			走		to walk, move; to go, leave
超	to transcend			chāo	0366	12	Things that are beneath us tempt us to be satisfied with less than we are capable of. It is the things that transcend us that summon us to walk the path to a higher state.<br />Note in this and the following frame how the element for walk can embrace other elements from below, much the same way as the element for road does. In order to do this, the final stroke needs to be lengthened. [12]	&quot;super&quot;		超		to overtake, exceed, transcend; ultra—, super—
越	to surpass			yuè	0367	12	Here we see two parades in competition, each trying to surpass the other by walking at breakneck pace from one town to the next. Note the little &quot;hook&quot; at the end of the first stroke of the element for parade. This is the only time it appears like this in the characters treated in these books. [12]	(<u>not</u> <i>to transcend/super</i>)		越		to exceed, surpass; to climb over
是	to be			shì	0368	9	"""To be, or not to be: that is the question"" Hamlet's soliloquy is a prime example of how memorizing a little Shakespeare can mend a tongue wagging in the mouth* transforming the bro­ken speech of everyday English into a few minutes of golden eloquence. Like Hamlet, we, too, are riddled with doubt. ""To Shakespeare or not to Shakespeare: that be the question"" [9]"			是		is, am, are; to be; yes
題	Topic			tí	0369	18	The topic of your term paper appears at the top of the first page. That be what your paper's about, dude. [18]			题		topic, subject; headline; to inscribe

延	to prolong			yán	0371	8	To prolong something enjoyable, like a vacation, is to stretch it out for as long as you can. If you look closely, you can see a stopper (the long drop) halting the progress of the footprints of time. [8]			延		to prolong, extend, delay
誕	Nativity			dàn	0372	15	The key word, of course, calls to mind the feast of Christmas. As the famous poem at the start of St. John's gospel tells us, the nativity we celebrate at Christmas had its origins at the very start of time and governs all of human history. Celebrating the nativity prolongs the memory of the eternal Word in time and space. [15]			诞		birth; birthday; bear children, give birth
楚	clear			chǔ	0373	13	If you build a zoo in the woods, the animals might feel comfort­able, but the visitors wouldn't get a clear view of anything but the trees. [13]			楚		distinct; clear; orderly
礎	Foundation			chǔ	0374	18	This character depicts a cornerstone, which was not—as it is today—a decorative slab of marble set in a corner of a finished building. Rather, it was the first stone laid as a clear guide for all the other stones to follow. It was, quite literally, a foundation stone. [18]			础		foundation, base
衣	Clothing		❖ When this character is used as a primitive element, particu­lar attention has to be paid to the changes in shape that it can undergo. In fact, it is the most volatile of all the charac­ters we shall treat, and for that reason we will assign distinct meanings to each of the variant shapes.<br />When it appears to the left, it looks like this: 衤 and we shall generally take it to mean a cloak or cape. At the bot­tom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the top hat) are omitted, giving us: A, which we shall take to mean a scarf.<br />On rare occasions, the final four strokes are drawn with the first two strokes slightly repositioned to give us JOc. We will refer to this element as a bandana. An example will not show up until frame 610.<br />Occasionally the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first two strokes appearing at the top and the last four at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitives: in which cases we shall speak of a top hat and scarf.<br />And finally, of course, the element can keep its original character shape, along with its original meaning of clothing in general.	yī	0375	6	At the top we see the top hat, and at the bottom a pictographic representation of the folds of a piece of clothing. If you break the four folds into two sets of two strokes, you will find it easier to remember the character for clothing. [6]			衣		clothes
裡	inside			lǐ	0376	13	All you need to do is imagine a computer sewn to the inside of your clothing, and you are equipped to begin your career as a<br />spy. [13]	"(not ""internal"")"		里		inside, interior, within
哀	Grief			āi	0377	9	A drunken sot in a tattered top hat and soiled silk scarf with a giant mouth guzzling something or other gives grief to family and friends alike. It sounds like a role W. C. Fields might have played with relish. [9]			哀		sorrow; grief; pity; to grieve for, lament
袁	Yuan		Long robe	yuán	0378	10	It is used today as a family name, well illustrated by Yuan Shikai (1859-1916). As President of the Republic of China and successor to Sun Yatsen, he remains a very controversial figure. The lidded crock and scar/should be easy enough to associate with a suspicious politician.

遠	distant			yuǎn	0379	13	The distant figure on the road is Yuan Shikai, receding into the annals of suspicious politicians.[13]			远		far, distant, remote
壞	bad			huài	0380	19	When we introduced the character for water back in frame 126, we noted that one of its primitive element shapes (to which we assigned the meaning snowflake) often appears one way in block print and another in handwritten or calligraphic form. Here we see an example of just that. There are a lot of elements to work with here in creating a story for bad. It begins with dirt and passes on to the top hat and scarf which sandwiches two more elements: eyeball and snowflake. Now, while some people have the capacity to find something good in everything, here we see a pessimistic aristocrat (in top hat and scarf) with his eyeball fixed on a snowflake and looking for the tiniest speck of dirt in it to satisfy his macabre view of reality. [19]		<i>vis: earth+Baba Yaga</i>	坏		bad; evil; rotten, spoiled, broken down
初	elementary			chū	0381	7	"The primitives here take care of themselves: cloak and dagger. And to whom might those terms apply? ""Elementary, my dear Watson."" [7]"			初		at first; (at the) beginning; junior, basic (level)
巾	Towel			jīn	0382	3	The basic meaning of this character is a towel. Its shape sug­gests a super-thin fashion model who has just stepped out of the bath and thrown a towel over her shoulders. [3]			巾		towel, scarf, turban
布	Cloth			bù	0383	5	Hunk of a bolt of terry cloth that the maid drags along by her side, cutting out new towels as they are needed and saving her­self the trouble of doing the extra laundry. [5]			布		cotton cloth, textiles, linen
帽	Hat			mào	0384	12	Because of some risk or other (you decide on the details), you tie up a makeshift hat out of a dirty old towel. [12]			帽		hat, cap
幕	Curtain			mù	0385	14	Instead of the usual gates, this graveyard has a curtain at its entrance sewn together from towels that the occupants had sto­len from hotels around the world, come back to haunt them after death. So next time you think of slipping that beautifully imprinted towel with the logo of a hotel into your suitcase, remember that one day it will be curtains for both of you. [14]			幕		curtain, screen; tent
棉	Cotton			mián	0386	12	Cotton usually grows on bushes, but here we see it growing on a rather large tree. The clumps of cotton are big, in fact, the size of large white towels. When you get tired of picking, you take one of them and use it to wipe your brow. [12]		{---- 帛 [bó] silks<br />From 白 bái phonetic over 巾 (jīn) 'towel'.<br />        Compare 帕 pà which contains the same two components.}	棉		cotton; cotton padded
幫	to help			bāng	0387	17	Dutch boy who helped save the town<br />!n the dike, you help save<br />lesson l8 I65<br />ur apartment from an-overflowing bath by sealing off the bot­tom of the bathroom door with a white towel [17]			帮		to assist, support, help

(An ancient ceremonial garment.)<br />        ""Picture of lianas"" --Karlgren(1923). (Possibly, originally a different character from 'knee cover'. See 芾 fú).<br />        Supposedly, this component also occurs in the form 十 over 冂 in 南 nán, 索 suǒ and 孛 bó; the right-hand element of 姊 and 秭 may also derive from 巿."	肺		lung
帶	Sash			dài	0390	10(11)	The part of the apron where one finds the buckle (represented pictorially by the first six strokes, whose order of writing should be carefully noted) is on the sash. It may help if you think of one of those giant flashy buckles on the title belts that profes­sional wrestlers compete for. [10]			带		belt, band, girdle, strap
滯	stagnant			zhì	0391	13(14)	"People who have been ""sashed"" to something (whether their mother's apron strings or a particular job) for too long are like water that has stopped moving: they become stagnant. [13]"			滞		sluggish, stagnant ; to block up, obstruct
刺	Thorn			cì	0392	8	(primitive thorn: 朿 Here we see a belt of thorns wrapping itself around a tree and choking the life out of it. [6])<br />The full character for thorn differs only by the addition of the saber to the right, presumably to indicate how the poor tree feels as it is being cut into by the heartless thorns. [8]	(full character)		刺		thorn, sting, prick; to pierce, stab, thrust
制	System			zhì	0393	8	This character shows a unique system for leading a cow to the slaughterer's saber: tie a belt about its waist and fix that belt to an overhead cable, pulling the cow up into the air where it hangs suspended, helpless against the fate that awaits it. [8]			制		system; to regulate
製	to manufacture			zhì	0394	14	To manufacture <i>clothing</i> nowadays one needs an international <i>system</i> of production and distribution.

云	to utter		"❖ When used as a primitive element, this character will take the meaning of a <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">rising cloud</span> of something or other."	yún	0395	4	This character is meant to make visible that invisible but oh-so-famUiar rising cloud of hot air originating at the podium of some boring professor you know who utters his pet theories while looking off into the distance with an air of self-absorp­tion, completely oblivious of his audience.

雨	the Rain		"Used as a primitive this character can mean either <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">rain</span> or <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">weather</span> in general. To conserve space, it is usually con­tracted into a crown by shortening the second and third strokes into a crown like this: Note how the four dots are straightened out in this case."	yǔ	0396	8	This character, also a primitive, is one of the clearest instances we have of a complex pictograph. The top line is the sky, the next three strokes a pair of clouds, and the final four dots the rain collected there and waiting to fall. [8]			雨		rain; rainy
雲	Cloud			yún	0397	12	Here is the full character for cloud from which the primitive for a rising cloud derives. Clouds can begin with rising clouds of vapor that ascend from the surface of the planet and then gather to form those dark, ominous clouds that eventually dump their rain back on the earth. [12]			云		cloud; Yunnan (abbrev.)
雷	Thunder			léi	0398	13	The full rumble and roar and terror of thunder is best felt not with your head tucked under your pillow safe in bed, but out in an open rice field where you can get the real feel of the weather. [13]			雷		thunder
電	Electricity			diàn	0399	13	Think of the legend of Benjamin Franklin out in the rain flying a kite with a key on the string. (If he had actually used a key, he would have run the danger of being electrocuted.) This charac­ter knows better, showing us only a pictograph of the kite. [13]			电		electricity; electric, electrical
霜	Frost			shuāng	0400	17	Think of frost as a venture in which the malevolent forces of weather cooperate with one another. See them sitting around a conference table and finally deciding to allow a small amount of moisture to fall just before a short and sudden freeze. [17]			霜		frost
冰	Ice			bīng	0401	6	"This is the full character for ice from which we derived th* primitive element in the previous frame.

天	Heavens		"❖ The primitive can mean either the <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">heaven</span> of eternal bliss or the general term for sky, the <span style=""font-weight:600; font-style:italic;"">heavens</span>."	tiān	0403	4	This character is meant to be a pictograph of a great man, said to represent the Lord of the Heavens. (You may, of course, use the elements ceiling and St. Bernard dog instead.) [4]			天		day; sky; heaven
夭	to die young			yāo [普], yǎo [國]	0404	4	"If you've ever wondered where the St. Bernard dog got its name, this character suggests a plausible answer. The first of these friendly Alpine canines, originally known simply as ""Bernard dogs,"" died young in a sudden avalanche. Being blameless, she was wafted right up to her heavenly reward and fitted out with a halo one size too big for her hallowed head (the extended drop of the first stroke, written right to left). Centuries later she was ""caninized"" and came to be known as St. Bernardette, which later chauvinist theologians altered to Sr. Bernard. [ 4 ] "			夭		to die prematurely; tender; gentle

手	Hand		❖ Keep to the etymology when using this character as a prim ,itive: a single hand all by itself.	shǒu	0548	4	Any way you count them, there are either too many or too few fingers to see a good pictograph of a hand in this character. But that it is, and so you must. [4]			手		hand

才	Genius		The primitive meaning, geniey derives from the roots of the word genius. Use the genie out of the bottle when the primi­tive appears to the right of or below another primitive; in that case it also keeps its same form.

奶	Milk			nǎi	0583	5	Woman … fist/only then . [5]			奶		milk; woman's breasts; nurse
及	to catch up with		♦:♦ As a primitive, this will stand for outstretched hands. Only take care not to confuse it with beg (frame 434).	jí	0584	3(4)	"The addition of a final stroke transforms this character from the primitive for a clenched戶into the character for catch up with. Observe how eliminating the hook in the second stroke and slanting it to the left gives the character a more elegant form.<br />Sometimes our emotions get ahead of us and it takes a little time for us to catch up with them.

又	again		♦:♦ Etymologically, this character is said to be a pictograph of the right hand, hence its inclusion in this lesson. You can always take right hand as its primitive meaning, as we will see in just a few frames. More commonly, however, we will try to avoid confusing it with other primitives of similar meaning by assigning it the meaning of crotch, as in the crotch of an arm or a tree. Or whatever.	yòu	0589	2	You should have no trouble remembering this short two-stroke character, since you will meet it again and again in its primitive meaning.

谷	Valley			gǔ	0645	7	Look closely at the character in this frame and the one right above it and you will see the difference between the priEQitive element for eight and that for animal legs: the second stroke in eight bends gracefully outwards, while in animal legs it just kind of drops down.<br>But this doesn't tell you what animal legs are doing on top of an umbrella. The answer lies in the mouth of the valley, which is what you should think of when you see this kef word.

The key-word meaning, <b>malicious</b>, should not be far behind.

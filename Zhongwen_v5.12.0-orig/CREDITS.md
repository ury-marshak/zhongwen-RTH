The Zhongwen Chrome extension was written by Christian Schiller with
contributions from the following people:

* Todd Rudick (http://rikaixul.mozdev.org/)

* Jonathan Zarate (http://www.polarcloud.com/)

Furthermore, Zhongwen would not be possible without the work of all the editors
who put together, and constantly improve and update, the
CC-CEDICT dictionary: https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict

I also want to thank John Pasden from AllSet Learning
(https://www.allsetlearning.com/about/) for creating, and suggesting
Zhongwen be integrated with, the Chinese Grammar Wiki.

Thanks also to Nick Winter from Skritter for his assistance with
setting up the API for integrating Zhongwen with Skritter.
